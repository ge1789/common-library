<!-- CHAPTER 13.<br>JOSIAH AT BAY-->
<p>During the time Patience and Dorothy Fox were under Captain Verschoy1e’s escort driving to the Shoreditch Station, Grace Hanbury was anxiously waiting for them.</p>
<p>A slight accident had detained the Fryston train for more than an hour on the road, so that Grace did not reach London until after her mother and sister were due at Paddington.</p>
<p>Fearing if she then went on, they might cross each other, she remained where she was, in a state of great anxiety and trepidation; doubtful as to what they would do, whether they would think it best to come on or to wait; and knowing her mother in any case would be nervous at not seeing her.</p>
<p>The hour she had given for their drive from Paddington had passed, and she was standing on the steps irresolute as to the expediency of her taking a cab and starting off in search of them; when, to her unbounded relief, they drove up.</p>
<p>“Oh, mother! I am so delighted to see you,” she exclaimed. “I have been so fidgeted about you both. Dorothy, my dear, give me your bag. I started from Fryston so as to have more than an hour to spare; but the engine of our train broke down, and I was detained on the road for nearly two hours. Of course I was in an agony to know how you would get on, for” —looking at Captain Verschoyle— “I feared you were alone.”</p>
<p>“So we were,” said Patience, “but at the station we most fortunately met Charles Verschoyle, and he kindly undertook to convey us safely here.”</p>
<p>“Wilt thou let me introduce thee to my daughter Grace Hanbury?” she said, turning to Captain Verschoyle, who was looking with some astonishment at this elegant woman, fashionably dressed, and very different from the person he had expected to find awaiting them.</p>
<p>Grace held out her hand, saying, “You have done me such good service in taking care of my mother and sister, that we must be friends at once. And now about your luggage: the Fryston train goes in ten minutes, and I think we might save it. If you will stay here, mother, Mr. Verschoyle and I will look after your parcels.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Patience addressing Captain Verschoyle, “we must not trespass further on thy goodness.”</p>
<p>“You must allow me to see you safely off, Mrs. Fox;” and he followed Grace, who was wondering who this good-looking man could be. “Verschoyle! Verschoyle! ” she could not remember any Friends of that name; “an admirer of Dolly’s perhaps; I must ask him to dinner.”</p>
<p>The luggage was soon ready. The train drew up, Captain Verschoyle found them a carriage to themselves, helped them in, looked after all their little comforts, and then stood waiting to see them start. By this time he had quite won Grace’s heart; and she said, “I hope you will come down to Fryston and see us. It is only a short journey from London, and we can give you a bed.”</p>
<p>Patience was so taken aback at this speech, she hardly knew what to do; and at that moment it was impossible to explain to Grace the slight knowledge they had of the young man whom she mistook for an intimate acquaintance.</p>
<p>Captain Verschoyle saw her confusion; and thinking it perhaps arose from the difference her mind made between their positions, he answered—</p>
<p>“You are very kind, and I should like to come of all things; but unfortunately I was thinking of leaving town to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go to-morrow, come to us to-morrow; I want to introduce my husband to you.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you don’t mind having me to-morrow, I will come with pleasure.”</p>
<p>“I am so glad,” said a soft voice. It was Dorothy, who, meeting Captain Verschoyle’s eyes turned suddenly upon her, became crimson. She had not intended to give utterance to her thoughts; but she was so glad he was coming that they might see him again. Twenty times during the last two hours she had wished Josiah Crewdson were like him, not only in appearance, but in being able to know everything you wanted without being told, and in saying such pleasant things.</p>
<p>Dorothy need not have been so hard upon poor Josiah; sympathy might have softened her comparisons, for just now it was she who was self-conscious and shy, sitting silent while her mother and Grace talked to their new friend.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hanbury gave him all the necessary instructions about the train he was to come by, and then they had to say “Good-bye,” leaving Captain Verschoyle standing, hat in hand, watching their departure.</p>
<p>“What a handsome man, mother!” exclaimed Grace, as soon as they were out of hearing; “so nice too, and gentlemanly! Who is he?”</p>
<p>Patience gave her the history of their acquaintanceship, and Grace was much amused at it, and her own mistake; “for, of course,” she said, “I supposed he was a friend of yours; indeed,” she added, laughing, “I was not sure he was not a lover of our little Dolly’s.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Grace,” cried Dorothy, while all the blood seemed rushing to her face, “why, he is a soldier.”</p>
<p>“A soldier! what, one of father’s old enemies! Why, you look as horrified, child, as if he were a Mohammedan. Dear me! how father used to lash those unfortunate red coats, until I longed to take up the cudgels in their defence. But I daresay he has changed many of his notions against them since the war; for notwithstanding our prejudices, we Friends would have fared badly but for these ‘sons of Belial,’ as Dorcas Horsenail used to term them.”</p>
<p>“Ah! thou must not laugh at Dorcas,” said Patience; “her peculiarities are few, and her good qualities many. When any of the soldiers come home sick or disabled, Dorcas forgets whose sons she calls them, and makes them her own charge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and you will see, mother,” added Grace, “that all these prejudices which Friends have held because their grandfathers held them, will die out; while those principles which they have sifted for themselves, will continue as long as the sect exists. As for the love of fighting, it is born in boys; I believe it is their very nature.”</p>
<p>“What dost thou think I heard father ask cousin Josh when he came to see us?” said Dorothy, — “If he did not remember at York school how they used to fight the boys of other schools, when they got a chance, because they called after them ‘Quack, Quack!”</p>
<p>“That is splendid — oh! we will hold that as a rod in pickle over him, Dolly.”</p>
<p>The rest of the journey was taken up in giving an account of all the west-country Friends, most of whom were known to, and many connected with Grace.</p>
<p>As Captain Verschoyle drove back to his hotel, he laughed to himself. This unlooked-for meeting would detain him in town another day. Perhaps it was almost a pity to have accepted it, as there would be the bother of sending a telegram to his mother. However, it was done, so it was no use regretting ; and then he thought “How pretty that girl is! I don’t think I have seen another such face since I have been in England. I like her manner too, half shy and childish, and then suddenly becoming most prim and old-fashioned. The sister evidently does not belong to the Quaker persuasion, except wearing that plain dress and peculiar bonnet affair. I wonder at women having anything to do with them; and yet I don’t know if I should have admired her as much in the flounces and furbelows the girls deck them selves out with now; her very quaintness would be half the charm to some fellows. I have known men who would have raved about her eyes — they are lovely, and couldn’t she make them speak too! By Jove! I should think she made the hearts of all the <i>thees</i> and <i>thou’s</i> in the community palpitate pretty considerably.”</p>
<p>Whether in this respect Captain Verschoyle’s speculations upon Dorothy’s charms were strictly correct, does not appear; but certain it is, that one man seemed only to have found out that he had a heart since those brown eyes had met his, — not with the shy coy glances they gave to Charles Verschoyle, but with a fearless open gaze straight into his own, which could not, and if they could, dare not, tell her all he longed to say.</p>
<p>Josiah Crewdson had been home a week, though it seemed to him a year — a year of long separate days, every hour of which increased the growth of his love for Dorothy Fox. The time which, before he saw her, was willingly devoted to business was now given by force. He was obliged to make an effort not to think of the bewitching face which tormentingly came between him and those long rows of figures he used to run down and add up with such fluency and skill. Alas for poor Josiah! now that he knew the pleasure life could give, there was no more contentment in the joyless existence he had before spent.</p>
<p>He had given great offence to his sisters by his strict reticence with regard to his visit generally, and to Dorothy in particular. The Miss Crewdsons enjoined silence as a virtue to be especially practised by Friends. But it is not in the human nature of women, even Friends, not to be especially curious regarding those of their sex of whom they have heard much, and seen but little. The beauty of Patience Fox had been acknowledged, and her daughter was said to more than equal her in personal favour; therefore, though Josiah would have been severely rebuked had he dwelt upon Dorothy’s fair face, Jemima and Kezia itched to give that rebuke which their brother’s taciturnity drove them to withhold. Josiah answered “Yes” or “No” to any question they chose to put to him, but he volunteered not the slightest information, until Kezia was driven to say that concealment and mystery led to discord among families, and was a thing which their father particularly warned his son against. But the arrow fell aimless in its attempt to loosen Josiah’s tongue.</p>
<p>Then Jemima tried her hand, and remarked, that it was a pity Josiah had gone to see the Foxes in such a spirit, as, by his own showing, he had failed to produce a favourable impression upon Dorothy, who was doubtless a woman of discernment.</p>
<p>Then, to their great astonishment, Josiah turned upon them, told them to mind their own business, not to interfere with him, but to leave him to manage his own affairs. What he thought of Dorothy, or what she thought of him, concerned themselves alone, and he did not want it made a subject of any general or domestic conversation. But if they wanted to know what he thought of Dorothy Fox, he would tell them in a few words. And here Josiah’s florid round face became crimson, and he stammered and stuttered so violently, that he had to jump up suddenly, and seize his bed-room candle; while, between the futile attempts his unsteady hand made to light it, he managed to get out: “She’s the best, and the most beautiful, and the most clever, and the best tempered, and the sweetest girl I ever saw in all my life; and I hope she will marry me, and then I don’t care for anything else or anybody.” Having delivered himself of this pæan in favour of the lady of his love, Josiah wound up with an imprecation against the unfortunate candle, which was the neares approach he had ever made in his life towards swearing, banged the door behind him, and left his sisters speechless with astonishment at his extraordinary and unwarrantable effrontery.</p>
<p>For once in their lives the Miss Crewdsons seemed to become absolutely limp. Had they heard aright? Were they in their senses? Could these words, still ringing in their ears, have come from “that boy Josiah?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Jemima!” Kezia at last found breath to gasp out, “if father had been alive!”</p>
<p>“Then he’d never have dared to do it,” answered her sister; “but there’s more in this than meets the eye, and unless I am mistaken thou wilt find Dorothy Fox is a bold, forward girl, and no more fitted to be the wife of our Josiah than — than thou art.”</p>
<p>And then a solemn conference ensued, as to the best way of rooting out of Josiah the “flesh and the devil,” which two evils had evidently taken hold of him. One thing they both decided upon, which was, that for the present they had better not mention the subject to him, but let him alone as he had said, and preserve towards him a demeanour indicative of great injury, unwonted severity, and strict silence.</p>
<p>So the next morning, when Josiah, some what abashed at his unusual boldness, desired to make amends by being especially attentive to his sisters, his amicable endeavours met with no response. Whenever they supplied any of his wants at breakfast, they did so with the air of those who don’t say they hope, but they shall be surprised if, they are not heaping “coals of fire” upon the transgressor’s head. And they sniffed their rather long noses, as if those organs were being gratified by the smell emanating from the retributory process.</p>
<p>Josiah drove into Leeds a trifle more dispirited perhaps than usual, but not so disconsolate as after former ebullitions of the family temper he had been wont to be. Now, at least in thought, he had some one to turn to. Surely, surely Dorothy would learn to love him. She had told him she liked him; and Nathaniel said that meant love, only it was the way of women not to speak openly of their feelings; that Josiah, by experience, could understand. He knew how impossible it was for him to tell her what he wanted to say; but if she only felt it, and would give him a little encouragement, he could say all that now seemed lying heavily at his heart.</p>
<p>So the day and its duties went on, and Josiah strove with all his might to bend his energy to his business, and not allow himself to give one thought to Dorothy until the Cloth Hall was closed, the good bargains made, the opportunities seized upon.</p>
<p>Then he threw himself into his well-worn office chair, looked at his watch, found it was past four o’clock, gave a sigh of relief, thought of Dorothy, and wondered if she was thinking of him. Perhaps so. She would be most likely working; or he pictured her near the old yew-tree — her favourite seat — reading (for he knew nothing of the letter then on its road, telling him of her journey to London).</p>
<p>Was she thinking of him? No, indeed!</p>
<p>Fortunately for Josiah, he has no magic mirror, by whose aid he can see Dorothy, or read her thoughts. If he had, he would have found they were not only far removed from him, but given to another; and for that other Dorothy (though she would have fairly denied the charge, and would have been shocked at the accusation) had been spending more time in the arrangement of her hair and the adjustment of her plain dress, than she had ever done before; and, worst of all, when it was completed, she was never more dissatisfied with her appearance. If she had only some bit of colour on, she knew she would look better. So she picked from the box outside the window a piece of scarlet geranium, and held it up against her dress; then, after a guilty look around, she stuck it for a moment in her hair — how pretty it looked there! But a sudden horror of her vanity seizing her, she pulled it hastily out, smoothed the place over with her hand, and ran half-way down stairs, then back agiin, picked up the flower, and demurely came down with it in her hand.</p>
<p>Grace was at the door, just setting off to drive her ponies down to the station to meet Captain Verschoyle.</p>
<p>She nodded to her sister; thinking how pretty the girl looked, as she stood in front of the handsome old-fashioned house, watching the carriage until it was out of sight.</p>
<p>Fryston Grange, the house of John and Grace Hanbury, was one of those houses built at a time when people who lived twenty miles from London were as completely coun try-folk as the present dwellers in remote parts of Cumberland or Cornwall.</p>
<p>The railway had completely altered the people, but it had left the little town very much as it had found it. What was the use of building shops when most of the inhabitants went to London for all their household purchases? Then land for fresh residences could not be bought, as Fryston was encircled by a royal forest, on whose borders stood John Hanbury’s house, — a long, rambling building, with walls covered by a network of ivy, climbing up until their straggling sprays even reached and twined round the quaint chimneys. The windows opened on a lawn dotted over with pine trees, and here an old fir, there a cedar, farther on a fantastic willow. From between the trees the distant landscape opened — Warleigh — the Kentish hills, led up to by a rich display of timber in all its verdant stages.</p>
<p>John Hanbury was the only son of a wealthy merchant. His father had given him a liberal education, had sent him to travel for a couple of years, and had been delighted to find when his son returned that his heart was still faithful to his boyish love, Grace Fox, whose aunt had married Mr. Hanbury’s younger brother.</p>
<p>Grace was a great favourite with old Mr. and Mrs. Hanbury, who, though they strictly conformed in every way to the rules of the Society of Friends, had no objection to the more liberal notions of their son and his wife. Nothing pleased the old couple better than to see gathered round their son’s table the best society that part of the country afforded, and to be present at any festivities given at the Grange. So that the house Captain Verschoyle was going to differed in no respect from one belonging to the circle in which he generally moved, with the exception that it realised the word home, and within its walls presented a picture of thorough domestic happiness, such as it had never before been his good fortune to witness.</p>
