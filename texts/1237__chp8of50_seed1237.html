<title>Chapter 8 of The Favourite of Fortune by Curtis</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p>
‘The question is,’ said Mr. Harper to himself—he is seated alone in his chambers before that visit
to Prince’s Gate mentioned at the close of the last chapter. ‘The question is, am I bound to take a
man’s own word for it that he is alive when for years he has been supposed to be dead? A great deal
of course depends upon the nature of the man who comes boldly forward out of the land of shadows and
declares he has never been there!’
</p>
<p>
How can a man come out of a place he has never been in? Lynx-eyed critic asks the question with infinite
scorn; and also sneers at the idea of a lawyer talking of the land of shadows. But why not? may there not
be poetical as well as prosaic lawyers?
</p>
<p>
To say that a man has come out of a place be bas never been in is so clearly a bull that we must explain;
although indeed, as some witty person has said, life is not long enough for explanations. When a man
has been supposed by all his relatives and friends to have passed into the land of shadows, or, in plain
English, to be dead, may it not be said, when he reappears, that he has come out of the land of shadows,
although, of a truth, he has never been there at all?
</p>
<p>
‘But,’ as Mr. Harper said, still talking to himself, ‘a great deal depends upon the nature of the man
who makes an assertion of any kind; if he has always borne the reputation of a liar, he may be safely
suspected of lying under all circumstances, and especially may he be suspected when an unauthenticated
report of his death gets abroad. And, if he actually did die, some equally accomplished liar is now
personating him, and may be truly called the greater scoundrel of the two.
</p>
<p>
‘I think,’ said Mr. Harper, when he had amused himself by a variety of speculations somewhat foolish
and unbusiness-like, no doubt, ‘I think the probabilities point to the repentance of the wicked Gervais
Vandeleur himself; that is, he repents of his voluntary effacement of himself, whereby he gained
nothing whatsoever, and he thinks it is time to give his friends some more trouble. Let’s see again
what he says in his note.’
</p>
<p>
The speaker took a letter from his pocket and read:
</p>
<div>
<!-- Greeting and Gervais Vandeleur are in small caps, text is indented past the halfway mark of the page, Farewell and P.S. are indented normally  -->
<p>
‘Dear Harper,<br>
‘My remains salute you! There is but little of the old man, in the litera1, not allegorical, sense
of the term, left; but that little, I am proud to say’—’proud indeed,’ muttered Harper—’remains
exactly what it was when you last saw me. Come and verify the statement, like a good fellow; for
certain reasons, not necessary to explain, I cannot look you up just at present. Also, for certain
reasons, I must ask you to bring me a little cash; a temporary loan; nothing more.<br>
‘Yours, and to you only,<br>
‘Gervais Vandeleur.<br>
‘P.S.—I am known here as Mr. Morris.’
</p>
</div>
<p>
‘I suppose I must go,’ said Mr. Harper, as he put the letter away again; ‘but before I see him I
really must get all the ins and outs of the Vandeleur family once more clearly set forth in my head,
for I know I have let some of the links drop, owing to the impression we were all under that this
troublesome Gervais was dead. Now, let me see. I feel like the confidential servant who, in the
first scene of a play, gives the audience a hint in a soliloquy of the fan1ily complications, in
the matter of marriages and births, in the unravelling of which they are to assist as the lookers-on
who see most of the game. Well, I have no audience, but I feel that I must get all the Vandeleurs
clear in my head before I can get on.
</p>
<p>
‘It must be more than twenty years since the terrible scandal occurred in which this precious
Gervais played the principal part. Not that it was worse than hundreds of other scandals of the
same kind, but there was something in the way it was done that made it seem worse. I wonder if
Mrs. Portal is still alive? we know he did not marry her, for she enticed him a second time from
the woman who, unhappily for herself, did become Mrs. Gervais Vandeleur; her name was Bushnell,
I remember. And the hard part of it all is that, if the old scoundrel, whom I am going to see
presently, outlives poor Trevannion, he will succeed to the title and estates, and cut out my
handsome friend Dick. And, by Jove!’—here Mr. Harper rose in great excitement, corresponding to
the capitals in which be spoke—’ if Gervais has a child, it must succeed its father, be it boy or
girl. Good Lord!’—and the excited lawyer rubbed his head with both hands—’ what, a complication!
—what a sell for her ladyship! And I believe there was a child. In the first place, my lady will
not admit that her son is dying; she is also firmly persuaded that Gervais is dead, and, being dead,
it does not signify whether he left one child or a dozen; for, according to the terms of an eccentric
entail, a daughter cannot inherit except from a father, although a son may. Now let me cudgel my
poor old brain. Had Mrs. Gervais Vandeleur any children? My impression is that she had a daughter
a few months old when her husband went off the second time with Mrs. Portal. But what became of
this child, and what became of the mother? Probably they died; possibly they are alive. Poor dear
Trevannion, if we could but keep him alive until this old ruffian Gervais was really dead, everything
would go right, for Dick can inherit. I wish it would not be dishonourable to buy off Gervais. I
believe for a couple of thousand a year we might get rid of him and the girl, if there is one,
for evermore. <em>His daughter!</em> I can fancy what <em>she</em> is like. Brought up by Gervais!
But how I run on! How do I know he has her at all? Better go and see, I suppose.
</p>
<p>
The address given by Gervais Vandeleur was not an aristocratic one; no man with a balance at his
banker’s would have lived in such a hole. Evidently the celebrated Gervais—the notorious lady-killer,
the man whose name five-and-twenty years ago was so well-known, the man before whom women, fair,
fast, and frivolous, burnt so much incense, and combined to flatter and to spoil—evidently he was
down on his luck.
</p>
<p>
In a shabby room in a shabby, if not disreputable, house, not half-a-mile from the Seven Dials,
the lawyer found ‘Mr. Morris.’ In the midst of his sordid surroundings—for sordid they certainly
were, although the inside of the house was much less shabby and dirty than the outside—the man
looked what he was, a gentleman. Dissipation of varied kinds had done its work upon him, but, in
spite of the ravages of reckless living, the face was still handsome; the eyes, dark-blue in
colour—the Vandeleur eyes, as they were called—were not clear and bright, like those of young
Dick, but they had not lost their power of expression, and the beautiful mouth, shaded by the
long drooping moustache, could wear at will a smile as winning as it had worn in the days that
handsome Gervais was the talk of the town.
</p>
<p>
He was not old by any means, not more than fifty-five; but he had lived so fast and so free that
each year for the past twenty had almost counted as two, and now he had suddenly broken down. He
was asthmatic, rheumatic, dyspeptic, and neuralgic by turns, but still he battled against his
ailments and tried to appear hale and hearty; and it was only when he was quite alone, or in the
presence of the one person in the world before whom it was unnecessary to act, as she could not
be deceived, that he dropped the debonair air; fell, as it were, in to ruins, and let pain and
decay, with rapid steps or slow, bring him nearer and nearer to the end.
</p>
<p>
But he did not want to die; if he had but fought against temptation with half the determination he
now showed in fighting against death, his career would have been very different, and death itself
might have left him unassaulted for many a year. He had now appeared upon the scene again (and for
a dozen years or more he had been looked upon as dead), in order to take his proper place as
heir-presumptive to his nephew; he might not be able to ward off death’s last blow until he had acted
as chief mourner at the young lord’s funeral, but still the game was worth the candle, and be meant
to play it to the very end
</p>
<!-- believe it or not, the end of the above paragraph actually doesn't end with a period. Undoubtedly a mistake but I left it out to preserve the text as best I could. -->
<p>
He did not take any special or vicious pleasure in the thought that his sudden and unexpected
resurrection might cause discomfort among his relations, and he had by far too good an opinion
of himself to imagine that he would not be welcomed; if the fatted calf were not killed in his
honour, some less costly beast would no doubt be slaughtered, and as long as there was feasting
he was not particular. It never occurred to him that his nephew, Trevannion, might prefer to look
upon Dick as the future head of the family, instead of a girl of whom he knew nothing. As a matter
of fact, Gervais rarely looked upon any question except from his own point of view; in his own
estimation he would make an admirable Earl of Trevannion; if other people held a different opinion,
so much the worse for the other people; he was not bound to listen to the ignorant platitudes or
outsiders. Indeed, as a general rule, Gervais Vandeleur rarely listened except when Gervais Vandeleur
spoke.
