<p>
Bewildered, and uncertain what to surmise, Lucie Alston left the room at the entreaty of Eva, and sought
for her son, hoping from him to hear a coherent explanation of the mystery. Had a bull chased the poor
child? or, had any accident happened to any one, the sight of which had thus disturbed her? These questions
suggested themselves to Mrs. Alston—the true state of the case had never done so. They had both been her
children so equally and naturally, that although the idea of Eva’s marrying had often occurred to her,
never once had Victor’s name been coupled with hers in her wildest dreams.
</p>
<p>
With all her good sense, and her common sense, and her refinement, she was essentially an unworldly woman,
one who never could have been initiated into the ways of the world, the common every-day working life
of the people around her. No woman could have been better qualified to mould a girl’s character into all
that was loveable and estimable in woman, in high religious principle totally divested of the cant, and
pretence, and hypocrisy of fashionable sects, but few were more incapable of managing her worldly interests,
as the world estimates them, than Lucie Alston.
</p>
<p>
Had she been asked to select a spouse for her charge, birth and refinement would have been prominent
qualifications in her ideal, but worth of character would have been her chief aim. Her own sad experience
would have made her cautious, a dread, a more than usual terror would occasionally possess her, when she
thought of the time which was approaching, in which her treasured charge would be a mark for the selfish
designing fortune-hunter.
</p>
<p>
She began to reproach herself that she had not trained her mind from the first to combat these dangers
which must inevitably assail her; but Victor had never raised a hope, or a fear, in his mother’s breast
in connexion with Eva.
</p>
<p>
She found him at last in her own little sitting-room, the bay window of which opened on the flower garden,
—her especial garden and Eva’s, in the arrangement of which the gardener had to obey instead of command —
but his back was turned to the cheering prospect which offered itself to his view unheeded—he sat with his
face buried in his hands, a perfect picture of prostration and woe.
</p>
<p>
He had braved and defied the General, he had scorned him, but before his mother he felt the most bitter
abject degradation. His offence was against her, upon her he was bringing sorrow, and anxiety, and
perplexity, do what he would, that he could not avert from her. He must <em>go.</em> Go somewhere from her,
his precipitate folly had made that step unavoidable, and it would break her heart.
</p>
<p>
All his love and tenderness for Eva, faded before his sense of shame at the reflections on her, which his
conduct had drawn forth. That man will slander her to the world, and the world will believe him, because it
is what they would have done themselves! and I shall be to blame—I who ought to be her shield, her protection
from any breath of reproach!
</p>
<p>
Victor was too deeply engrossed in this self-torture to hear her step as she entered the room, until she
gently stroked his hair.
</p>
<p>
“What is this? What is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Mother, where is she?”
</p>
<p>
“In her room, and she has had some great shock. What has happened?”
</p>
<p>
 “Has she not told you? Mother! your son is a wretch!—But from weakness rather than from intentional evil.”
 And he looked in such misery and despair at her, that her terror increased.
</p>
<p>
“My son, I know nothing, and Eva says you must tell me; she came home and fainted, and since then she has
not been sufficiently calm to explain to me what has happened. Thank God, you are both safe,—but what has
occurred?”
</p>
<p>
Victor sank down on the floor, in an attitude which had been habitual to him from childhood when inclined
to win over his mother to any proposition to which he was not sure of gaining her consent;—half kneeling,
half sitting, on the floor beside her, he buried his head in her lap.
</p>
<p>
“Mother! I love Eva, and I told her so; she returns my affection, and there has been a scene with—<em>that man.</em>
Believe me, never until in an unguarded moment I betrayed myself, did I think of what it would all bring
upon you. Now I see it all! She is very young, teach her to love me <em>as a brother,</em> for I never can,
and never will be any thing nearer than I am now, until I am her equal in the world’s eyes, until you are
clear from the suspicion of having encouraged us.”
</p>
<p>
“My poor boy!” was all Lucie could say, as her tears flowed silently over his head, and she prayed God to
support and comfort him.
</p>
<p>
“Mother, say you forgive me; try and think as kindly as you can of me, after bringing all this worry in the
house to you both.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear children, you have my pity and sympathy—all I can give. It is so sudden, so unexpected, I cannot
even realize it to myself yet, but I fear I could not, dare not, encourage it; if I did, others would oppose,
and it would be useless. Were she my own child, and I could dispose of her as I wished, I should desire no
happier lot, but—oh, God! strengthen me to do what is right!”
</p>
<p>
“Mother, you will have nothing to do but comfort and sustain her, and teach her to forget me. <em>I</em> must
<em>do</em> all that is to be done. Your’s is woman’s work—endurance. I would go now, this very moment, but
<em>he ordered me to go,</em> so I must remain to let him see that it is beyond his prerogative, for her sake.
Oh, Mother! shield her from that man! You can do it, except where I am concerned. I know you will, I know you
can, but to do it effectually there must not be the shadow of a suspicion of interested motives, or your power
would be lost, your <em>prestige</em> gone. I know you to be incapable of worldly motives, even for <em>my</em> sake,
and she knows it too; but the world, mother—the world would accuse you of betraying your trust, and I would
not bring suspicion of dishonour on you!” and he jumped up and strode impetuously to the window, and looked
out. Far down across the park he saw the figure of his antagonist moving among the trees. “Lucifer in the Garden
of Eden!” said he, “but he will not tempt my Eve,” which simile did not seem very relevant to his mother,
though she smiled through her tears.
</p>
<p>
“His office seems rather to prohibit than to seduce with forbidden fruit.”
</p>
<p>
“He is a fiend all the same, whatever his motives may be. Mother, that man has an ulterior object of his own.
It is not Eva’s welfare he is thinking of. Depend upon it he has some design of his own. Herbert, perhaps?”
</p>
<p>
“And he thinks we have. No, my son, we must not judge him. He thinks as the world thinks, and believes he
is doing his duty. Let us do ours, that is all for which we are answerable, and God in his good time will
work all out for the best. But, Victor, what plan do you propose for yourself? I must lose you for a time,
that is inevitable. But where do you intend to go? Perhaps Sir Godfrey may think of something, and I can
write and see you often.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother, it cannot be, after what has happened. India, or America, or Australia for me! nothing nearer home.
I must not be within reach of temptation, I could not stand it. I have nerved myself for the step now, and
I will take it.”
</p>
<p>
Lucie’s countenance fell; she had been thinking of another town, something within reach, but Australia or
India!—Her only son, her stay and comfort! It was too hard!
</p>
<p>
“Mother, hear me: she, Eva, loves me; she has offered to resign her property, to brave her guardians for my
sake, and she would do it. She is too pure and noble to understand the wrong, the folly of this; she would
urge it on you; she would tempt you and tempt me. Do not think me a vain fool for the idea; do not think it
is vanity which induces me to draw that conclusion—it is because I know her so well; know that now she is
aware of my feelings towards her, there are no sacrifices she would not make for me, or for you, but she is
too young to estimate their value or their bearing now. She must do nothing rashly; she must never know how
I love her, what sacrifice I am making for her, what you are suffering in losing me. If in years to come she
remembers me, and I succeed, then,” and his face brightened, “we may see happier days. Now you must think
only of her. Go to her, mother: tell her how I repent; tell her I will try and forget her, as she must forget me.”
</p>
<p>
The poor mother sat with the tears flowing fast from her eyes, and with her son’s hand clasped firmly in her
own. He was going to leave her and so very soon, to leave her to commence again the battle of life in which
for the few last years of hers, there had been a lull. She saw his duty clearly before him, and saw him
resolutely undertake it, dreading only that he might be tempted to swerve from it. She saw her own—her own
clear, hard duty before her,—the fulfilment of her trust. She set herself firmly to do it, as it presented
itself to her, yet with the full conviction in her own mind that it was not her ward’s real interest that
was to be attained, not her happiness, nor her peace of rnind, nor her welfare which was to be preserved,
but <em>her money.</em>
</p>
<p>
That which her father toiled for to purchase happiness for her, her happiness was to be sacrificed to preserve;
yet she was too deeply interested to be able to exercise her power to save her, to save him! the dearest
interests of both were to be sacrificed that this vile dross should be saved! “God, I pray thee teach us to
do what is right now, and leave the issue in thy hands,” murmured she. “God strengthen you, my boy, in your
resolves, and give me grace to aid you! for, Victor, something tells me his blessing will attend you and
prosper you, if your motive of action is always <em>to do his will.</em> I thank God that although you have
not felt called to the church, that in this hour of trial, my boy, you have shewn <!-- yep, it's shewn -->a strength of character I
scarcely hoped you possessed. He will bless you, my child, my only one, I know he will.”
</p>
<p>
“Not your only one, mother, Eva must now be doubly dear to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Doubly dear now for your sake, as well as her own, but not my <em>own</em>; oh, if she were, that vile man should not
have the power to make her miserable!”
</p>
<p>
“Mother go to her, tell her all as kindly as you can, only hold out no hope for the future. If she remains
true to her own heart, she will be her own mistress some day, but do not let her imagine I trust to this.
Let her be quite free. I must of course see her before I leave, and we must part as friends—dear friends,
but I will meet that man at dinner to day, tell her what he said, and that it is for her sake I remain. If
I were to go in obedience to his commands, it would establish a precedent for the expulsion of any guest she
may in future wish to entertain, and who may not have my pluck. Have you nerve to appear for her sake, mother?”
</p>
<p>
“It will be painful, but still necessary. I will not fail, but I will go to her now, and be guided by her
wishes in every thing, except upon the one point.”
</p>
<p>
During Lucie’s absence, Eva had time to collect her scattered thoughts, to realize to herself the scene through
which she had passed, and an overwhelming sense of shame took possession of her as she remembered her weakness
and cowardice.
</p>
<p>
“Why did I run away? why did I not stand and confront him and shew him that I was proud, not ashamed of Victor’s
love? Oh he will think it was guilt made me run, instead of only foolishness! I had never been in such a position
before and I was unnerved, but he shall know that I am not a baby; I am a woman now, and though I am not of age,
he shall not treat me like a child,” and she sprang from her recumbent posture, and paced the room.”
</p>
<p>
I have not yet described Eva’s personal appearance; and as some young ladies are seen to more advantage in
dishabille than in the livery of fashion, which reduces, beauty and elevates mediocrity, even occasionally
ugliness, within a certain level of uniformity, for one so very lovely, no time could be more appropriate to
sketch her, than when divested of the meretricious aids of dress, she is seen in the simplicity of her white
robes, her magnificent hair streaming about her, and every feature quickened with excitement.
</p>
<p>
She was rather, but not very tall, slight, round, and elastic, with feet of wonderful shape and appearing even
smaller than they were from their symmetry; her complexion was of that pale creamy white which occasionally
accompanies the darkest brown hair, and eyes of the deepest grey, eyes which are occasionally called black, but
which are more pellucid and lustrous than the usual black eye of the every-day brunette; her lips were full and
rosy, her teeth white, and her nose just a little <em>retroussé</em>, only enough, however, to give spirit to a
face which in its calmer moods, excited no suspicion of the character of which that countenance was the index.
Her greatest beauty perhaps, was to be traced in the splendid outline of her head, the manner in which it crowned
her magnificent throat, the ever-varying, and never-ending grace of her slightest movement.
</p>
<p>
This attracted the admiration of all, it was the poetry of motion, she was alike a beauty to the humblest, and
the most fastidious. It was the few alone who read in her sweet face, in the dimple in her firm, round, but
well-defined chin, in the well-cut lips and unfathomable eyes, a something more than the animated doll of
young-ladyism.
</p>
<p>
Eva had a will of her own—a will which had lain dormant under the sweet influence of her friend, a will which
prided itself on sacrificing on the altar of love. In all nonessential points, the sacrifice ever ready to be
offered up, was seldom accepted or required. Eva was mistress in her own house, and she knew it, and exercised
her authority as a little queen, a gentle loving queen, with the best and truest of prime ministers, one who
dexterously concealed the silken reins with which she guided the inexperienced hands that held the sceptre.
</p>
<p>
At no moment of her life had Eva looked more transcendently beautiful. Divested of her dress, her undergarments
loosened and falling from her shoulders, she was robed in a muslin dressing wrapper, through which the outlines
of her figure could be traced, and which left bare her slender but shapely, well rounded arms. Her hair fell in
thick masses to her knees, Fanella like.
</p>
<p>
Excitement sent more than the usual tint to her cheeks, which now rivalled the carnation, and lent additional
lustre to her resplendent eyes.
</p>
<p>
As she threw up her arms in a vain endeavour to collect her scattered tresses, the open sleeves of her jacket
fell back, displaying their rounded creamy whiteness, as her trembling hands glistening with gems, caressed
rather than collected her dark locks; a painter would have selected the moment to perpetuate her loveliness,
and transmit it to admiring descendants, among the prim and statelv dames who adorned the corridor, the more
<em>décolletée</em> beauties of Lawrence, a Lely, or the yet more distant eras of the Stewarts.
</p>
<p>
Among them, in her grand, earnest, but simple brilliancy, she would have surpassed them all, but alas! there
was no artist to appreciate or photograph her charms. Eva paced the room now in solitary pride, while those
who loved her best were planning disappointment, and misery, and woe.
</p>
<p>
She would see the General, she would explain all, she would tell him mhy, in her unaccountable folly, she had
ran away instead of boldly avowing her intention of marrying Victor. “Let them keep my money if they like, what
use would it be to me unless he shared it? They never can dare to withhold their consent if I am firm and
determined,” and she fixed her little mouth into the sternest expression of which it was capable.
</p>
<p>
She glanced at her mirror for the first time in her life perhaps, in proud triumph. “He would rather have me
than my money, I know,” thought she. “Oh, if I had only been some poor girl, then I need not have almost to
force myself on him on account of that foolish pride of his! and yet he is not proud, I know all he feels, and
I like him for it, and yet I am so provoked with him for his stupidity in not being superior to such worldliness,
I must cure him of it!” And Eva threw herself into her luxurious arm-chair, again surveyed herself with evident
satisfaction, and wondered if she would look as handsome upon her bridal day, and yet still assured herself
that money was <em>useless.</em>
</p>
<p>
She glanced at her watch, it was nearly dinner time! at least time to dress. She must look her best for two
reasons, to confront the General, and to gratify her betrothed, for that was her idea of Victor’s position
towards her now. She rang for her maid.
</p>
<p>
“Fowler, my white dress, please, trimmed with green,—the new one.”
</p>
<p>
Fowler demurred, “there was no one expected, and that other dress, pale rose, was just suited to a home dinner;
it would be a pity to take the first freshness off of that charming toilet until it had been seen by strangers,
it never could look as well after being ironed out.”
</p>
<p>
Eva flashed round at her maid in a style quite new to Fowler.
</p>
<p>
“I generally please myself, Fowler, in the selection of my dress,—the white one I shall wear this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss! the state of your hair to be sure! was ever such a tangle?”
</p>
<p>
“I came home faint and headachy, and Mammy has been bathing my head, and I only shook it out to dry.”
</p>
<p>
Now, although Fowler had not been called, nor indeed any servant disturbed, from Lucie’s instinctive dislike
to initiating them in a domestic crisis which she saw at a glance had taken place, rumours had been rife in
the lower regions that “something was in the wind.” These sagacious commentators on our actions, generally
know more of our inner life than we suspect, often more than we know ourselves; and in the servant’s hall
bets had been freely offered and taken, upon the probability of a match between “our <em>hairess</em>,” as
these worthies ca1led her, “and that young gent.” One, the footman, who happened to know the Alston pedigree,
vowed that he was the “hekal of hany countess in Hengland. He had seen his tree, and the roots were in the
deluge before Holiver Cromwell and William the Conqueror, and Mr. Wictor was one of the most ‘ansome branches
on the top of it. His cousin was a ‘<em>bart</em>,’ and hever so many hearls and nobility was hallied to the
family hiscutcheon, past and present, and although he was a younger branch, the hold ‘eds was by no means strong
parties; he would hoffer four to one on Sir Wictor, ten years ‘ence. Dudley was well enough—city parties he
should say, from ‘aving shares and stocks, and such like trade connexions; but the Halstons stuck to the land,
they were county people, his huncle had been a tenant for three generations.” Upon this the old family coachman
declared “that he should be kicked out of the house if he was worth it. His young lady was a hairess, and if
that conceited young hupstart, whose name he would not mention, was to read ‘istory instead of trees, and plants,
and such like unnaytral ways of putting ‘uman beans down in books, ‘ee would find Dudley was a name as took the
shine out of Halston.
</p>
<p>
“Who his Halston? What was they? If they came with the deluge, it was in the mud of it, no one ‘eard of them,
but themselves. Dudley ‘ad no need of trees stuck up on walls, and books to shew what they was; read ‘istory,
sir, and hold your tongue about Dudley, if you please.”
</p>
<p>
At this Fowler had started up and minced out that “true love had nothing to do with geological trees. It would
be sweet to have a tender romance under their own roof. Miss Dudley was worthy of a coronet, fit for a duchess,
but then to barter the ‘art’s affections for filthy lucre, and a crown on her ‘ankerchief! (It was the only place
they ever wore them except on their letters). Mr. Halston was like an ‘ero in a book, so tall, and so dark, and
so commanding, and yet so kind and civil spoken. It would be like a story out of ‘Woman’s Mirror,’ if it only
turned out a match, for of course, the course of true love never did run smooth.
</p>
<p>
“That old <em>vinagerette</em> would be having his finger in the pie, and be the cruel guardian, but it would
come right in the end, and the dear girl would perhaps confide in her, and she might perhaps be like Agatha
in the ‘Lover’s Trial,’ the means of bringing all to pass, and in the end captivate a gentleman rejected by
her mistress. Mr. Toots married Susan Nipper, and he could make her comfortable.”
</p>
<p>
Part of the above was expressed in words, other portions never found utterance, but they beguiled the imagination
of the abigail with visions of the future, in which she hoped to take an active part. Nothing had transpired to
give them a clue, but certainly Miss Dudley had come horne “flustered,’,
<!-- NOTE: the comma after the apostrophe after "flustered" is located in the vertical middle of the line, halfway between a comma and an apostrophe -->
“gardener had seen her running home, and there had been something out of the common when she went to her room
with Mrs. Alston, and no one rung for, nor nothing,—then the gent comes ‘ome, and ‘as been confabulating with
his ma for the matter of an hour, and he looked like a sceptre when he came in, and went poking into hevery ‘ole
and corner, and yet pertending he had somethink to do.
</p>
<p>
“There’s summut up.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s my bell, I must mind my business, and it would be as well if you attended to your own, instead of
intruding into the delicate affections of a sweet young creature like my young lady.”
</p>
<p>
In this rather sentimental mood Fowler entered upon her usual evening duties. She was prepared for sighs,
and sentiment, and blushes, but she was quite at a loss to understand the transformation she encountered.
</p>
<p>
The painted cheek was no fleeting blush; the sparkling eye, the imperious gesture, spoke more of temper than
love—”she was as though she had grown three inches since morning, and was ready for ‘igh ‘eels to make her
‘igher,” said Fowler afterwards.
</p>
<p>
“Oh Fowler! don’t pull my hair so! begin at the bottom and clear it gradually. I want it done in that new way,
rolled under and then looped up in hanging plaits behind.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there any one to dinner, Miss? I heard that General Dudley thought you the picture of his grandmother,
Lady Betty Dudley, when you wore your hair in the Eugenie style, it is so new and <em>distingué.</em>”
</p>
<p>
“I will never wear my hair in that style again, I hate it! I don’t want to be like any body’s grandmother,
I would rather be like myself,” and Eva looked defiantly in the glass, and the reflection was not unsatisfactory
to her in her present mood. She was going to defy one guardian, and coax over another, in order that she might
confer happiness upon her lover; and in her girlish fancy, much depended upon an imposing appearance, a womanly
presence.
</p>
<p>
“Here are my keys, Fowler, get me that brooch set in diamonds with the miniature in it,” (and to herself), “his
face shall confront them all from the grave! Let them look at it, and dare to make his child unhappy!” and her
little feet tapped the floor, as she writhed under Fowler’s manipulations, for truth to say that functionary
was so engrossed with curiosity, and her young lady was so unlike “an ‘eroine” of her fancy, under what she
imagined or suspected to be the circumstances, that she was quite distracted, and performed her office with
unusual awkwardness.
</p>
<p>
“Your diamond brooch, Miss!—it is for a fuller toilet than a plain domestic circle.”
</p>
<p>
These speeches were all intended to elicit a clue to the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“I intend to wear it, nevertheless, and my bracelets too,” and she put them on, and surveyed the effect. Her
own innate good taste told her that nothing could add to the effect of her beautiful hair, while any ornament
on her neck would conceal rather than bring out its pearly loveliness, and faultless outlines.
</p>
<p>
“Your toilet, to my experience, Miss, is too old, too womanly; something more simple and innocent like would
suit your style better. Lady Snelgrove was very particular on that point with her young ladies; nothing but
a souvenir, or some trifling little thing until they were married. Even when Miss Dora was a <em>fyancy,</em>
she never wore any jewellery, not until she was married.”
</p>
<p>
“A very economical arrangement, no doubt, for a lady with many daughters; but you see, Fowler, she is not my
mother, thank goodness; and as I have pretty things, I like to wear them, and dear Mamma never prevents me,
especially that picture.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment the colloquy was interrupted by a knock at the door, and Lucie entered, her face still bearing
traces of her late emotion. She could not entirely conceal her surprise at the change which had taken place
since she left Eva, prone on the bed, in all the lassitude of recovering faintness.
</p>
<p>
“My darling child!”
</p>
<p>
“My darling mother! See how well I am after lying quiet a little! Headache all gone, and I am quite ready
for dinner, which is more than you are; and look there,” pointing at her watch; “come along and dress,” and
making a grimace towards her abigail, she intimated by it that her <em>rôle</em> was taken, and that her
patient friend must follow suit.
</p>
<p>
In the privacy of her own room—for Lucie did not iadulge in a personal attendant when Maggie was not with
her—the two surveyed each other in silence for a few seconds, then Lucie’s lips quivered, and tears fell.
</p>
<p>
“My poor child!” (and her arm encircled her waist).
</p>
<p>
“Poor! I am only too rich for my own peace, Mammy, so I found out to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“He told you all?”
</p>
<p>
“He did,” (and Lucie’s tears fell faster).
</p>
<p>
“Then, dear Mammy, go on dressing; make yourself as smart as possible, as I have done, to Fowler’s no small
mystification. I intend to do heiress to the general to-night. I intend to conquer him, and have my own way;
and don’t, please, crush my new dress, it is like depriving me of one of my weapons. Don’t mind, Mammy, you
understand why.”
</p>
<p>
“My dearest Eva, you look flushed and fevered, and I fear you are taking a wrong view of the state of the case.
There is no time to tell you all, but General Dudley has forbidden Victor the house; and he says for your sake,
as your guest, he will remain for a few days, but only a few, to show him that you alone are mistress here.”
</p>
<p>
“Forbidden <em>your</em> son—<em>my</em> house! How dare he?”
</p>
<p>
“He is one of your guardians, Eva, and is exercising an undoubted right in one way, but as he has rather
transgressed in courtesy to you in another respect, Victor disputes his right to expel him, except through you.”
</p>
<p>
“I will let him see I am mistress here, at all events,” and her proud young figure dilated. “To ensure my
happiness was my dear father’s first thought, and to make me good, and he secured you to me to effect both,
and oh! if he were here now, he would give us his blessing, I know,” and her eyes filled and her lips quivered.
</p>
<p>
“Make haste, Mammy, my mind is made up; tell me the rest after dinner. I must make up to Victor for my babyish
shyness in running away. It was so dreadful to think of that man’s intruding upon us just at that moment;” and
she glided out of the room.
</p>
<p>
“How shall I tell her?—how shall I bear up under it all?” was Lucie’s ejaculation as the unconscious girl
vanished from her sight. “Yet Victor is right; she is too young to be capable of understanding the sacrifice
she meditates, and it would be infamy to him and to me <em>in the world’s eyes.</em> Oh, the world! the world!
why are we such slaves to it?”
</p>
<p>
But the bell sounded loud and clear through the house, and with forced calmness Lucie descended to the
drawing-room in time to be handed in to dinner by General Dudley, and to see Eva follow proudly on Victor’s arm.
