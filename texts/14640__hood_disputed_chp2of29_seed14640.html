<!-- chapter title: THE SEA AND THE SEA-FOG. -->

<p>When Emma said she loved Denzil, she said no more than was true. From the moment when she and her brother were transferred to Tresellan she
took a fancy to him.</p>

<p>But she openly owned to being the future wife of Aubyn. This she did of her own accord entirely, and further ratified the engagement by marking all her doll’s clothes with A. T. The good-tempered, <i>laissez-faire</i> boy, made no protest, and seemed tolerably content to have his future planned with so little trouble to himself.</p>

<p>His father looked on it, first as a childish freak. But since, to his not very scrutinizing eye, the attachment seemed mutual and lasting, when the years rolled by the thing became talked of as settled, and Emma was looked on as the future Lady Tresellan.</p>

<p>That Aubyn did not love her, and, as he grew up, ceased even to be flattered by her election, I think was pretty evident from the little care he took to be with her. Nor was she, on the other hand, desirous of his company. As soon as Denzil’s voice was heard returning (and when he grew to be a young man, his absences were long and frequent), Emma flew out to meet him and hear all his news (which, by the way, was little), and to pay him all those little attentions which are so delightful to man when received from a pretty girl, after an absence from home and home conveniences. Let him come when he would, he never failed to find a nicely-starched lace cravat, and a pair of fresh-whitened gloves ready for him in his bed-chamber.</p>

<p>Denzil was a handsome dandy, and you may be sure did not like these little attentions less because they came from another man’s affianced,
even though that man was his brother. To tell you the truth, he loved his brother no better than he did Emma, or, indeed, anybody else that we
know of at present. But it suited his purpose to feign affection for ” dear Nem,” and he did so with an aptness that spoke him no novice in the
art of deceiving women.</p>

<p>Poor Aubyn ! what with his good-nature and his general trust in everybody, especially his brother and his cousins, he was completely blind to what another man would have seen in a moment—strangely blind.</p>

<p>So when Emma refused to kiss him night and morning, alleging that such familiarities were not allowed between engaged people, but saluted Denzil as a “dear brother,” Aubyn only said, “Well, I think you might kiss me as well as Denzil, for I feel just like a brother to you, Nem.”</p>

<p>At which ungallant speech Sir Abel laughed till he choked, and had to be revived with a tankard of morning ale.</p>

<p>Frank Rewth, the young reprobate, was, in the sense of being a fast little dog, more of a man of the world than our Aubyn. He made so free
as to tell the latter that, ” were he troth-plighted, he’d be hanged if any one lipped the girl but himself.”</p>

<p>Aubyn answered, with his grave smile, ” Dear old Frank, our Nem knows best. I could trust Denzil with my life ; and had any but you, Frank,
hinted this of your sister, why— ” and he touched his sword, but with a merry smile.</p>

<p>Boys wore swords in those days, and those who wore swords did not often keep them long without getting them blood-rusty. Even Master Frank, lad though he was, had crossed rapiers with a tipsy cornet of dragoons for some foolish word-play with his name. So when Aubyn touched his hilt, Frank took off his hat, and drew his steel with a flourish, laughing all the while. So the two saluted, and then sheathed their blades again.</p>

<p>But when they parted at the ferry, over which Frank was going to tease the bare-legged fisher-girls on the other side, he said to Aubyn, with an
air of much wisdom, ” Have a care ! Never trust a woman too much. I never met with one that was worth the price of a yard of ribbon, or was more to be trusted than a tuft of grass on the face of a cliff to save a man’s life !”</p>

<p>Now, as Frank’s experience of the fair sex went no further than a flirtation with the canteen-woman of the regiment he had visited, I think it desirable to chronicle an opinion so valuable.</p>

<p>Aubyn strolled back up the cliff again, and when he got to the top, he leant his arms on the rail that ran by the side, and looked out to sea.</p>

<p>The waters were very calm, and rolled in heavily like oil, scarcely breaking on the beach at all. The wind was little, and the sun feeble, and
clouds of sea-fog were rolling toward the land. The Deadman’s Head was lost to sight, while the promontory of Earn e, far away on the other side,
was becoming rapidly enshrouded too, for the mist was driving up the Channel. Some cold influences had condensed the humid vapours floating on the surface of the great Gulf Stream, as it swept by, fertilizing the far extremity of Cornwall, and had sent the rolling cloud in solemn march, from headland on to headland, before a south-westerly wind.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was on account of the uninviting character of the view seaward ; but before long Aubyn’s eyes began to wander to a little cottage built on the quay, at the further end of the semicircle, in which the town nestled.</p>

<p>This was the residence of Christopher Pentowan, the lawyer. His office was at the side of the house, opposite the Ship Inn, the sign of which, by the by, appeared to be a careful copy of the great galleon on Sir Jasper’s tomb.</p>

<p>Christopher Pentowan was a lawyer after the devil’s own heart—a money-lender, a devourer of the poor, an oppressor. Town scandal added to
these titles the further one of smuggler. For in those days smuggling was a profession much followed ; and many a suspicious vessel hovered about
the mouth of Polvadnick harbour, in spite of the watch and ward held by Sir Abel Tresellan, J.P., and conservator of the customs of his gracious
Majesty George II.</p>

<p>You have probably pictured this usurer as a lean Shylock ; but you are wrong. He was a fat-faced, rosy, double-chinned fellow, with a deep, full voice. His sentences rolled out round, sleek, oily, and seeming-savoury, as you may note sausages issue from a patent machine. Great was this hero at public meetings and festive dinners, but greatest at small festivities. Happy was he who sat in company with him, and reposed beneath his calm glory. To look at him, you could not have believed it possible that this man was really a Shylock. And yet he was. True, he never did actually cut his own dinner out of his clients’ persons; but he served their hearts so cruelly that I don’t think he would have cared much about any number of pounds of the flesh nearest to it.</p>

<p>His face, fat as it was, and crowned with black ringlets, had an air of handsome vulgarity ; and, if he had lived to our time, he was the sort of man to wear an expansive white waistcoat and a double shirt-frill, and to make excruciating puns at small tea-parties in a Sir Oracle voice.</p>

<p>” And can this man be a rogue ?” you ask me. I am sorry to say, yes. And yet he had his good point, for if he devoured widows’ houses, he certainly never made long prayers, whether as a pretence or otherwise.</p>

<p>In one thing he resembled ” Jephthah, judge of Israel.” For ” he had one fair daughter, and no more, the which he loved passing well !” And
she, by that merciful arrangement of woman’s nature, for which we men can never be sufficiently grateful, did not see his faults and sins ; but clung to the old reprobate as fondly as if he had been the best creature in the world.</p>

<p>Lucinda Pentowan was a handsome girl—not one of your flaxen-haired dolls, but a tall, straight woman, with black hair and dark eyes. Her arm
was an arm of flesh and blood, the latter running pretty visibly under the brown skin. As for her hand, she could not have squeezed it into the
largest ” six and a half” gloves that ever were made—for she was no <i>mignonne.’</i> There was something queenly about this lady ; and in looking at her picture, I feel, as I do when I see that of Mrs. Siddons—”This was a woman to live and die for, who would live and die for the man she chose.”</p>

<p>It was to catch a glimpse of this figure, possibly, that Aubyn turned his eyes towards the cottage, and he certainly watched it for a long
time ; until, with a start, he recovered from his reverie, and shaking his head, turned down the path to the ferry.</p>

<p>He had been so buried in thought that he had not observed Sir Abel’s passing him as he stood there.</p>

<p>Sir Abel, as I have told you, had been in Italy. As a youth, he had been somewhat of a wanderer ; and the see-saw of life had gone up and down with him pretty often.</p>

<p>I don’t think he was a sad man, or wished to have his past life back again. Men of his age do not do that, I fancy.</p>

<p>I remember, at the university, when I was crossed in love, or crossed at the kitchen and buttery, and had to send out for my dinner to the
incomparable Bickerstaff, that I had a way of smoking a gloomy pipe, and quoting, from some quarter or other, the line—</p>

<hr> <!-- Sentence below is centered and smaller text in the original. -->

<p>” Hei mihi preteritos referret si Jupiter annos.”</p>

<p>Now, if I am sick and sorry, I don’t always take the pipe, and I <i>never</i> take the quotation. Why should Jupiter refer our preterite years to us? I’m afraid we should not do much good with the remittance.</p>

<p>And so, though Sir Abel was a grave man, I don’t think he was a sad one ; for he was content that the past should be past, and he had a modest
hope and belief in his future.</p>

<p>There were times, though, when he was fain to get away from the presence of his second wife, and to carry his thoughts out to sea.</p>

<p>Then he would go down to the beach, and taking the porter’s lad with him, put out his little sailing-boat, and skim away before the wind. He continued this habit after his wife’s death.</p>

<p>When he passed Aubyn, he was going on this very errand, and was, I believe, as unconscious of his son’s presence as his son was of his.</p>

<p>The mist was still flying along the channel. Now and then a skirl of wind would lift it for a moment, and then down it settled again.</p>

<p>One such momentary clearance showed Sir Abel’s well-known boat to the knot of fishers gathered at ” the town-head,” as the space between the church and the sea-wall was called.</p>

<p>” Eh, lads ! ” said one gray-headed old man, ” I’d a gi’en my next catch o’ mackerel not to ha’ seed yon boat out to-day ! “</p>

<p>“How so, Cap’n Jack?” was the general inquiry.</p>

<p>The old man was looked on with great awe by the superstitious fishermen, for he was held to have second-sight.</p>

<p>“Well, then, ye do know as how as Sir Jasper were wrecked on to Sharpyhead yonder—”</p>

<p>” Ay, sure ; and he were mad, and ‘tis in the family now, I reck’n,” added several; while one murmured—”Ess, and some o’ ‘em ha’ gone mazed since, and they all begin wi’ the same words, some’at about ‘say-dogs,’ so I’ve aheerd’em say.”</p>

<p>” Well, then ! ” said the old fisherman, who had waited patiently for perfect silence, “this very morn, as I corned down to carr’ my nets to
barkin’, I seed a great ship (so large as the church ‘twere), and it corned in right on to Sharpyhead, and then I seed some one come right out to bowspurt-end, and throw up his arms. And then it all sinked away into the mist. I tell ‘ee I seed un so plain as I see yon hosgead o’ pilchers ! ” and he pointed to a neighbouring barrel of those delicacies.</p>

<p>The little group loitered about in the hope of hearing more, but the aged prophet was silent. He continued to mend his net, an occupation which
he had interrupted when the sudden shifting of the sea-fog revealed Sir Abel’s boat.</p>

<p>Half an hour after, as the old man got up from his seat by the pilot’s hut, the report of a gun, deadened to a dull flap, like the sound of a bird’s wing, reached his ear. The sound was very dead, and hardly waked an echo in the many-hollowed valley of the Perl.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, Mas’r Denzil,” said the gray-haired fisherman, “there ye are firin’ on they poor choughs, that ne’er harmed you nor yourn. God send that they poor birds’ homes may be the on’y ones where there’ll be wailin’ to-day ! “</p>

<p>Now, as Master Denzil did not happen to be out shooting choughs, as any one might have concluded after a moment’s consideration of the thickness of the fog, I will leave my readers to believe or not, as they choose, in that second-sight of the old man’s, for which all his neighbours gave him credit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Abel and the boy were skimming away out to sea, the boat, ” with a bone in her teeth,” now running up the long side of the
swell, and then, after a pause amid the foam at the crest, hissing down on the other side. There was no boat along the coast that could touch the
“Dark Lady”when she heeled over before the wind, and dashed along with a wall of water, two handsbreadths high, above her leeward quarter.</p>

<p>The “Dark Lady” was running on the starboard tack, when Sir Abel, with a sudden grasp of the tiller, brought her round trembling and quivering
before the wind. The cause of this sudden manœuvre lay before him. A long, low, rakish-looking vessel was lying-to about a quarter of a mile from him ; while, between him and it, a boat, piled with bales, and rowed slowly by eight oarsmen, was making toward the shore.</p>

<p>In a moment Sir Abel read the meaning of all this. The smugglers had taken advantage of the fog to bring their vessel as close in-shore as they
dared, and were now unloading her cargo, which seemed a large and valuable one.</p>

<p>With Sir Abel there was no question as to what he should do. He was alone, and unarmed, it was true, but he was a justice of the peace, and
he could never allow the rascals to land their run right under his very nose.</p>

<p>Besides, the story would be told about him, for such stories <i>did</i> creep into good society in those days. So he bore right down on to the boat ; and standing up when he got within hailing distance, he summoned the crew to surrender in the king’s name.</p>

<p>A loud laugh was the only answer he got. But as he still kept overhauling them, one of the crew stood up and shouted out, ” We know you,
Sir Abel ; but keep off, or, by heaven, we’ll fire into you ! “</p>

<p>” Fire away, and be cursed ! ” said Sir Abel, his noble old face lighting up. ” It shall never be said I let a scum of rats land under my very nose ! “</p>

<p>” Keep off, Sir Abel ! ” cried another voice ; there are those here that can’t let you see them and live. If you value your life, put about ! “</p>

<p>” Cowardly dogs ! let them face me like men, and I’ll meet them, and punish them with my own hand, on sea or land, and keep their secret till then ! “</p>

<p>You must remember at the time when this challenge was given, the gentry knew a great deal about running cargoes, and were not loath to lend
their cellars for purposes of concealment; nay, pulled an oar themselves at times of a dark night perhaps.</p>

<p>The only answer to Sir Abel’s defiance was another warning. And then as bis boat came nearer, a rosy round face, with a hat pressed down over its forehead, appeared over the heap of bales in the middle of the boat.</p>

<p>The warning was repeated, but was again unheeded, for Sir Abel was trying to identify the fresh face.</p>

<p>” Your blood on your own head, Abel Tresellan! ” said a deep, rich voice, and Sir Abel saw the glint of a gun-barrel.</p>

<p>He never flinched. As he stood up there in the bows, with the water hissing at his feet, he only smiled gravely. And the whole of his past life, and the light of the faith of a true Christian and English gentleman, flashed before his eyes in a second.</p>

<p>” Lord have mercy ! I am doing my duty ! ” he whispered. And then the shot rang out ! Sir Abel fell back on the thwarts, a martyr to those miserable laws, that, like the game-laws of our time, were rather temptations than prohibitions : laws that made the lives of “men with
mothers dear,” and ” men with sisters and wives,” the price of the lace that fluttered on my lady’s shoulders, or the silk that whispered about her dainty feet.</p>

<p>When Sir Abel sank back in the boat, the poor frightened lad with him put about with all speed, as he was bid to do by those in the larger
boat.</p>

<p>Kneeling in the bottom of the skiff, he took his kind master’s head in his lap, and wiped the foam from his lips, and strove to staunch the
blood that came oozing out of the bullet-wound in his side.</p>

<p>Presently the Head at Tresellan looked down upon them from out of the fog ; and soon the little boat, with a trembling sail, as if conscious of
its terrible burden—a dying man—lay-to along side of Polvadnick pier.</p>

<p>Loud was the lament among the fishers of Polvadnick when they saw the plight of their patron. As soon as they gathered the already half-guessed truth from the boy, the pilot-boat was manned, and the coast to westward searched, but no sign was seen either of schooner or boat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with careful tread, four stout men carried their wounded master home on a rude litter made of oars and old sails.</p>

<p>Tho gray-headed seer was among the busiest in the construction of this, and spent all his care in so arranging the canvas that no blood should fall on the stones, muttering to himself an old local rhyme—</p>

<hr> <!-- Sentence below is centered and smaller text in the original. -->

<p>” The clear shall seem dark, and the dark shall seem clear,
When the blood of Tresellan is red on the pier.”</p>

<p>And as Sir Abel was lifted from the skiff, a single drop fell among the slippery weed, and ran away out of sight unnoticed.</p>
