<!-- CHAPTER 19.<br>AT MR. FAIRHOLT'S -->
<p>“How was the fire caused?”</p>
<p>Greyford rang with this inquiry, which was put to us so many times that we were quite tired of hearing it. It was a problem to solve which all our powers needed to be brought into exercise.</p>
<p>On that never-to-be-forgotten night we retired to rest, but not to sleep. It is not so easy to lull the heart that has been wrought up to a very passion of fear; and that was my case. There is no sickness like that induced by fright; it takes the life out of one, turns bravery into cowardice, the strength of hope into the weakness of despair. This sickness was upon me the whole night through, and when the dawn broke and I looked out of the window, the sight of what remained of our house, our home which had sheltered us, and seen us so happy, was enough to rob me of what little resolution I possessed. It looked like the wreck of what it had been. The garden, once our pride and delight, had been trodden down; what was left of the house had been disfigured by the smoke and water which had played about it, the windows were broken in, the whole place was the picture of desolation. Looking at it, I had resort to woman’s best cure for sorrow — a good cry. It was not merely a summer shower in which I indulged, but a passionate torrent, and I felt as refreshed after it as would the thirsty earth on a parching July day after a heavy downfall of rain. No one seemed to have slept that night.</p>
<p>Mr. Fairholt, and my father, and the servants, all said they had been too much excited to sleep. It was a very sad breakfast, our host doing his utmost, in his own genial, kind way, to bring the smiles to our faces; but he was quite unable to do it. Before we had finished, Kate came in, looking very white and scared.</p>
<p>“I ran off directly I heard the news,” she said. “I did not believe it could be true, but I see it is. Oh, father, what shall we do?”</p>
<p>“You need have no fears, Miss Kate,” said Mr. Fairholt; “a fire does not mean ruin, though it may and does include both loss and inconvenience. We should look at our mercies, you know; and I think it is a great blessing that, happening in the night as it did, no lives have been lost.”</p>
<p>“So it is. I was afraid to think what it might be. Mrs. Marah was almost as frightened as I; for a boy whom she questioned, who had just come from Greyford, declared that ‘the foreman’s house was burnt down to the very ground, and all the people were burnt in their beds.’ She wanted to come with me, but of course she could not leave her—”</p>
<p>Kate stopped suddenly. She had but just remembered of whom and to whom she was speaking. Mr. Fairholt looked at us curiously; he saw there was something wrong, though he was too gentlemanly to appear to notice.</p> <p>Of course the fire-office sent down an inspector, and we were questioned and cross-questioned as to the origin of the fire; and all who were in any way connected with us had to submit to an examination.”
<p>What <em>caused</em> the fire?” That was exactly what we could not tell. My father declared he had no idea; and as for me, I was almost ashamed even to whisper the absurd suspicion which had arisen in my mind.</p>
<p>“You remember the priest, father, and his threat? Do you think he could have spoken so bitterly of us to any one that—”</p>
<p><em>“Mary!</em> what can you be thinking about?”</p>
<p>It served me right, that tone of rebuke. I knew I deserved it, and tried to bear it meekly. I was really ashamed of my own uncharitableness; but how could the fire have originated?</p>
<p>Father, however, did tell the detective, who had come to see what he could find out about the place, what I had said. He, a very simple and innocent-looking man, a Romanist, too, looked at me as if he thought I was scarcely in a fit state to be at large, and had better be taken care of at once. So that nothing whatever came of my wicked thought. The inspector appeared satisfied, and father was given to understand that the money would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>But as a long time must necessarily elapse before our house could be again made habitable, we thought it would be better to look out a small house for ourselves not far from the factory.</p>
<p>Mr. Fairholt, however, would not hear of that.</p>
<p>“I have been quite congratulating myself,” he said, “that the fire, though it may be bad for you, was very good for me, for it brought me some companionship. If you can be at all comfortable here, I do hope you will stay and make my house your home until your own is ready. You have no idea of the benefit you would confer upon a lonely man, who has no friends to cheer him.”</p> <p>Of course we agreed to remain, and we had reason to be very glad of the decision.</p>
<p>It is quite true that the best, perhaps the only way really to know people is to live with them. We did not know Mr. Fairholt before; we had a little surface knowledge of him, it is true, but we did not understand how great and good and really kind he was. Always in his home, a man may be expected to throw off all disguises. But the real character may prove to be less loveable than the assumed. It was not so with Mr. Fairholt. We saw his best side in his own house. Every day at dinner-time there was a scene which might grace the house of hundreds of our rich men. Little children or girls came to the kitchen door with plates in their hands. They had each a sick mother, an ailing sister, a disabled father, or a weak brother, to whom a good dinner was a great thing. How often a doctor says to a poor invalid, whose resources only admit of weak tea and bread, “There, now you will do. All you want now is plenty of good nourishing food to make you strong.” He might as well tell them to go to Madeira, or endeavour to take apartments in the moon. They <em>cannot</em> get either sufficient or nourishing food. To all such of these whose cases came under his notice Mr. Fairholt had one speech — “Send somebody round to my house every day about one, and there will be a dinner for you.”</p> <p>Knowing that he meant it, they took him at his word.</p>
<p>Not only did handy little brothers and sisters come, with plates and saucers, but for those invalids who were well enough to walk so far, a table was prepared in one of the spare rooms, where they might sit and take their dinner in comfort and in company. The very change from their own dull little places to a bright, cheerful room, with windows looking out into the well-kept garden, did the poor sufferers good, and helped to bring back their strength. Good, thoughtful, Christian man! He did not tell his left hand what his right hand did, and I think he was the surer of the blessing for that. How many glad hearts pray for such men as that, and surely their prayers are heard. Must not He who went about doing good, feel especial love for, and sympathy with, those who so closely copy His example of kind and self-denying solicitude for others? We saw how a Christian, with a good income and no near friends demanding its expenditure, should live, and I could not help wishing that others similarly situated, but who have no care beyond their own comfort and convenience, could have spent a few days with John Victor Fairholt, and learned his more excellent way.</p>
<p>Nor was this the only good work which he was doing. Every evening he had visitors, and they were principally young men from his own factory, with whom he had held conversations, and who had confided to him their wishes or troubles. It is a good thing when young men have a friend to whom they can go in an emergency. It is better still when that friend is their master, and, best of all, when he is a Christian man.</p>
<p>Mr. Fairholt was not the man to address crowds from a waggon, to gather groups at street corners, or hundreds in market places. He had no talent for exhorting sinners to repent while they were buying their Saturday night’s provisions. But he lived Christianity, and he improved every opportunity of speaking with quiet earnestness to the people with whom he came in contact. And, without any disparagement to those eager friends who can and do speak words of burning eloquence to multitudes, perhaps it may be found at last, when we see things as they really are, that these silent workers have done as much as those of whom more has been heard. He did what he could; what more can even angels do? Our blame will be not that we have not all been great speakers, or public benefactors, or mighty men of valour, but simply that we have not done what we could.</p>
<p>The thought of one young man is before me while I write. He had been a Sunday scholar, and a boy who was always accustomed to attend a place of worship. He came to live in Greyford when the people were very fond of lectures. And seeing a placard which announced that a lecture would be given at a certain place upon the Bible, he decided to go, not dreaming that there was more than one side to <em>that</em> question, and fully expecting to hear words similar to those which he had already read in a little book — well worthy of attention — called “The Lamp and the Lantern.” To his surprise and horror, he was told that the Bible, which he had so learned to love and reverence, was an idle tale, a book not to be relied on, fit only for weak women and idle children, and so bad that it ought not to be put into their hands even. At first, he had an impulse to get up and rush out before any more such terrible words were spoken. But he did not obey that impulse. He saw so many others who appeared quite calm and unmoved, that he felt a little ashamed of his own emotion. So he sat still and listened, and gradually got used to it, and heard unmoved what had at first so frightened him. He sat still, and let the poison enter his soul. He went again, his “friends” encouraging him to go and hear the other side, until at last he grew as unbelieving as the blasphemous lecturer himself, and felt quite ashamed of his former credulity and folly. But he was not much the gainer by it. He lost his peace of mind and grew first careless then melancholy. It seemed a grand and manly thing to laugh at the old-fashioned notions which his father and mother held, but it was a pleasure which left an after-sting. He grew restless and uneasy, and completely miserable. He was away from his friends, or a mother’s loving eye would surely have detected the change. But he had a friend who did. Mr. Fairholt watched the lad, and when he saw the evidences of an unrestful heart he invited him to his home, and by degrees led him to speak of himself, and so found out what was the matter. Then he talked to him, met his doubts with simple trust, lent him books, urged him not to question but to believe, and did not give him up until he had learnt to put his whole trust in the Saviour of mankind. You can imagine how gratefully this young man felt toward Mr. Fairholt, and how he blessed him for his kindness.</p>
<p>And this was only one of the good things he did. We found that his days were spent in doing good of one kind and another. And yet his own life was not a happy one. There was ever a shadow on his hearth and a pain at his heart that made every day dim.</p>
<p>It is often so. God seems to darken the lives of some of His children who bring such light into other lives. Why? Ah, that we do not know. Only He does all things well, and some day perhaps He will lift the clouds away and let in the brightness.</p>
<p>We had not been very long with our friend before we found that he had a new source of anxiety. His face grew sadder, his smile became more forced. It dated from a visit which a London lawyer paid him. He came and was closeted with the master for four hours, and when he left Mr. Fairholt looked as if he had a burden more heavy than he could carry. How we wished we could lift it from him! but of course we were not even able to guess what caused it.</p>
<p>But when he had borne it as long as he could, he did the best thing he could have done — he confessed his trouble to father. And I do not know whether he ought to have done it, but it troubled father so much that, not having any one else to tell, he told me.</p>
<p>“Mary,” he said, “what shall I do? Mr. Fairholt has told me a little of his history — that is, he told me that he was separated from his wife, and Popery had been the cause. Then he said that he believed she was living, but he had been unable to find her present address. ‘And,’ said he, ‘I had a lawyer here the other day to inform me that five thousand pounds had been left to my wife, and five thousand pounds to each of my children, by an old aunt who years ago promised thus to leave her money. I have no children, Mr. Swaisland, but I wish I knew where to find my wife.’”</p>
<p>“Oh, father,” I said, “surely you told him!”</p>
<p>“I did not know what to do. I was inclined, and then I thought I ought not to do it without asking Mrs. Marah’s permission.”</p>
<p>“I wish you had,” I said; “but perhaps it is not too late. Go and see Mrs. Marah at once and ask her; I am sure it is right that she should know.”</p>
<p>“If she says so I will tell him. Put on your hat and come with me, and I will ask her.”</p>
