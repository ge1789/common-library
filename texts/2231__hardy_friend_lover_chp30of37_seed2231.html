<!-- CHAPTER 30.-->
<p>It is early in the evening of a lovely day with all the glow of summer and all the freshness of spring. The level rays of the western sinking sun are gilding the windows of the little Breton village by the sea. Sea and shore are quiet at this hour; the wheels of a little light cart sound loud as they rattle down the street. There is scarcely a buzz even in the courtyard of the hotel. An hour ago there was bustle enough, when the diligence came in; but now all is quiet; the passengers have been packed away in such rooms as Madame Lagrange allots to them; the horses have been led off to the stables; the luggage unloaded; the old ramshackle coach that is ending its days as a diligence stands, with its empty shafts leaning help lessly on the ground, in a corner of the courtyard. Near the diligence, on a bench under a lattice-work, up which a straggling Virginia creeper climbs, a lady in deep mourning is sitting alone, a Tauchnitz novel in her hand, a tired indifference to it and to everything else in her attitude.</p>
<p>It is Grace Bloxham; and looking at her with eager recognition, from a door on the further side of the courtyard, is Roy Carrick, an hour ago arrived by the diligence, and now ostensibly wandering about the hotel to study its geography, really at heart in search of some member of the Forrest party, whom he knows to be in this place. Fortune favours him at the very outset of his peregrinations by bringing him face to face, at a dozen or so yards’ distance, with the very object of his search.</p>
<p>She is alone, pale and sad. Shall he speak to her, he thinks, or wait until some of the others join her? Now that he actually sees her, he feels the impulse that draws him towards her checked. He thinks he will not speak; he will hover near her unseen. But in the courtyard of an hotel this is easier thought than done. A waiter brushes past him with, “Pardon, m’sieur!” Another traveller crosses the courtyard; Grace looks up languidly for a time. She may see him at any glance; he cannot stand there staring at her. One minute he draws back into the hotel, the next he walks straight out and over to the spot where she sits.</p>
<p>She does not look up until his shadow falls at her feet; then she lifts to his face those deep-blue eyes that have never ceased to shine in his memory. They look larger than ever now that she is so worn and pale; their brightness is quenched as if by much weeping. She looks surprised to see him, but not greatly surprised; it almost seems as if she were too passive and abstracted to be much astonished at anything.</p>
<p>“You here?” she says.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answers, briefly, flushing as he half timidly, and consequently abruptly, offers his hand.</p>
<p>“How do you do?” she says, uttering the common-place greeting in a tone whose kindly courtesy is only a degree removed from indifference, and letting him take a hand that touches and melts out of his coldly as a snowflake.</p>
<p>“I have disturbed you!” he says, brusquely and uneasily. “You are vexed at seeing me?”</p>
<p>“Vexed? No, indeed! Only surprised,” she answered, and quite sincerely.</p>
<p>“I’m in this hotel,” is his next observation.</p>
<p>“So are we,” she rejoins; “indeed, I believe it is the only one in the place.”</p>
<p>“How is Mr. Forrest?” he inquires, with interest.</p>
<p>“He is quite well, thank you.”</p>
<p>“And Mrs. Forrest?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she is very well.”</p>
<p>There is an awkward pause, and then Grace observes,</p>
<p>“Miss North is here too.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” responds Roy, who is not surprised at hearing this, considering that, had he not gathered certain information from Roberta’s letters, he would not have been here.</p>
<p>“Are they out?” he inquires.</p>
<p>“Papa is out; Mrs. Forrest is writing letters; and Roberta is on the sands, I think.”</p>
<p>He does not feel very much interested in the respective pursuits of the other members of the party. Looking at her with a gaze perhaps too long and earnest for a mere acquaintance, he observes,</p>
<p>“And you? Are you well?” Then fearing lest this inquiry might sound too like an implied allusion to the past, he adds, hastily, “Does this air agree with you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I am very well here.”</p>
<p>The vein of cynic lightness, of brightness just touched with bitterness, in her manner, which had fascinated him the previous season — was it only a year ago? — is as utterly gone from her as her old girlish gaiety. But, glad or sad, blooming or faded, she was ever to Roy Carrick “the world’s one woman.”</p>
<p>Presently, one by one, the rest of the party sauntered into the courtyard. Max Forrest, handsome and gallant-looking, despite his nearly half a century of years, a man after whom women cast admiring glances still; his wife, sinuously graceful — she always seemed to glide rather than walk — in an elaborately exquisite “combination” of Worth’s, yclept a <i>“toilette de campagne;”</i> then Roberta, tall, and straight, and stately, in a dark, sober travelling-dress — a contrast to Leonor Forrest, and yet of as impressive, if less attractive, a presence. They all gave Mr. Carrick cordial greeting, and, being socially inclined, were genuinely glad to see him.</p>
<p>Then followed days which, if described to him one year ago, would have seemed a state of almost fabulous bliss — days spent in the same hotel with Grace, seeing her morning, noon, and evening — and Grace free, a widow, not a wife! — he himself on terms of pleasant intimacy with the family, welcome to join them in their walks, their drives, their hours of <i>dolce far niente</i> by the sea — and in each and all of these hours free to feast his eyes upon her face.</p>
<p>But the days which, in description, would have seemed of such unalloyed bliss, were in reality of a very mixed quality — their pleasure so veined and dashed with bitterness that grains of pure enjoyment were very few and far between. Of what avail was it to sit by Grace’s side when Grace’s mournful eyes were looking far away? of what avail to walk with her beside a moonlit sea, in all the serene beauty of a mild, late spring night, when he felt in every nerve that his presence was nothing to her, or such, at most, as a docile Newfoundland dog’s might be! Once or twice he even fancied that his society wearied her, and, under the sharp prick of this idea, he turned away and left her with abruptness almost rude while she glanced after him with mild surprise.</p>
<p>What made it the worse for him was that, while she was sufficiently evidently indifferent to him to make him curse his folly, she was just not indifferent enough to wound him to the point of going away. If his company made any difference at all to her, she rather liked than disliked it. He was one of the people she could always get on with, and — whatever in his morbid moments he might fancy — he was one of the few who now neither bored her nor jarred upon her.</p>
<p>Sometimes, not often, the recollection of that summer night when he had spoken to her those mad words of love, recurred to her. In the shock and storm of all the tragedy which had passed since then, she had forgotten it. She recollected it now, thought of it languidly, with a kind of incredulous curiosity. She looked back at it as if through a mist; it seemed so long ago, almost past remembrance, in another world — so far back that he too must surely have forgotten it.</p>
<p>And seeing Roy in every-day life, as she saw him now, cool and practical, laconic and calm to her, talking politics with her father, literature with Roberta, and social theories with Mrs. Forrest — it seemed impossible that he was the man who had for once burst into that passionate avowal of misplaced love — who had begged her forgiveness in such remorseful humility.</p>
<p>Still, as days went on, she found his presence gratifying; looked to him as to a safe, sure friend, felt a pleasant sense of reliance on and trust in him — even thought once or twice, with a half sigh, that she would not have minded having a brother like him. She grew so much at home with him that, on one or two rare occasions, she even dropped the defensive guard she held against all the outside world’s sympathy or curiosity, and let fall stray words which gave him a momentary glimpse into her troubled soul.</p>
<p>One evening they were all out on the sands; Grace, weary from a walk too long for <i>her,</i> though a mere stroll to the others, sat down to rest; Roy Carrick remained with her while the others rambled on.</p>
<p>The sands lay shadowy in the faint wide stretch of starlight; the tide was low, and the far-off sea was lapping the shore so softly they could hardly hear its murmur. They spoke a little of the beauty of the evening, a good deal of a poor and wretched family in the village whom Grace had been to visit, taking some little help to the dying father and the crippled child. Grace’s sympathies were moved by the once strong, stalwart fisherman, who had lain for months slowly dying inch by inch.</p>
<p>“How life clings on when it is an un welcome guest!” she said, gravely.</p>
<p>“And how often it slips away out of the hands of those who struggle to grasp it so tight!” Roy rejoined.</p>
<p>“It seems so strange and incredible to me now to think that there <i>are</i> those who cling to life,” she observed, with a kind of mournful wonder. “Yet <i>I</i>did — once!” she added, with a dreamy sigh.</p>
<p>Roy looked at her for a few moments, before he replied, it seemed at first not too relevantly,</p>
<p>“There’s a short poem of Browning’s — it’s in ‘James Lee’ — I don’t know if you know it? The burden of it is ‘Nothing endures.’</p>
<div>
<p>‘Nothing endures! the wind moans saying, so <br>
We moan in acquiescence.’
</p>
</div>
<p>But there are times when, hearing it, we do not moan — times when, in the evanescence of everything, there is hope. Nothing endures — neither night nor day. Just as surely as day closes into night, night brightens into day. The blackest night must end in dawn. Even the Polar darkness has its long daylight following.”</p>
<p>“Astronomically — and metaphorically — speaking, I suppose it is correct,” she as sented, wearily, despondently.</p>
<p>Roy felt his failure, and was silent; he looked down and drew patterns on the sand; and she thought she heard him stifle back a sigh. It occurred to her that she had not received his well-meant attempt at consolation gratefully.</p>
<p>“Hope and dawn do not seem to have much to do with me — that is the truth!” she said, with a franker tone. “But there’s one thought that bears some little solace or distraction with it. There is work in the world to do; some day I shall work — work till my work fills life for me. But in what line I shall find occupation I don’t know yet. And just now — now is a calm time with me — I feel like a ghost come back to earth!” She paused; it was strange how the mood had suddenly possessed her to cast her usual armour of reserve aside, and speak thus to Roy Carrick. He was looking at her now, and something in his mute, earnest gaze, or else in her own impulsive mood, moved her to continue — “I <i>like</i> to feel as if I were a ghost! I hate to feel awake — alive! When I <i>live</i>, pain lives too! It wakes and sleeps — lives and dies — with me. But this apathy, this shadow-life, in which I see without feeling, feel nothing — oh! this is a good gift!”</p>
<p>There was something so unutterably mournful in her tone that Roy, on his part, his heart swelling unbearably towards utterance, dashed the barrier of his own reserve aside. He spoke not impetuously, but slowly, with the deep earnestness of passion.</p>
<p>“If I could die to save you from sorrow, no tired man would lie down to sleep more gladly than I would lay down my life for you!”</p>
<p>She turned her head and gazed at him, neither indignant nor agitated, in a sort of calm and melancholy surprise.</p>
<p>“Is this the way in which you would speak to a ghost?” she asked, in the cold tone he knew too well, cold and soft as falling snow.</p>
<p>“You are no ghost to <i>me</i>,” he answered, steadily, sadly. “And when a man knows he may not live for a woman, the next thing he wishes is to die for her!”</p>
<p>“Keep your life and death for a worthier cause,” she said, cold and unmoved, but still with a sort of dreamy regret. “I thought you had forgotten that madness. Why, it is a lifetime ago! And you remember it still? You do not understand. Although I move, and breathe, and speak, the woman I was last year is dead — as <i>dead</i> as if she lay in the little cemetery yonder. You make a mistake in speaking to me as if I were that woman; do not make that mistake again!” she added, rather sadly than harshly.</p>
<p>“No,” he replied, in subdued tones; “I will not!”</p>
<p>A day or two afterwards, Roy Carrick left the place. At the hour of his departure, when the diligence was momentarily expected to rattle into the yard to pick up its freight, he found himself — partly by a happy chance and partly by a little more or less clumsy manoeuvring on his side — for a few moments near Grace, apart from the others. He seized this opportunity of saying the one word he had to say — the word which he could not endure the pain of leaving unsaid!</p>
<p>“We part friends, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, with one brief sad look.</p>
<p>“You don’t think the worse of me for all my stupid blundering? — it shall never annoy you again!”</p>
<p>“Nothing annoys me now,” she answered, calmly.</p>
<p>“Good-bye, then! As a friend — as a friend — I may see you — some day — some times?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we are friends. Good-bye!”</p>
<p>And he was gone.</p>
<p>The senior members of the party regretted his departure, and even Grace perhaps missed him a little when he was gone.</p>
