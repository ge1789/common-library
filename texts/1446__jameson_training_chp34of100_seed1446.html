<em>Phœbe’s letter to Eleanor.</em><br>
</p>
<p>
“My dear Sister Ellie,—I need not tell you how thankful I was to hear that you had arrived safely
at your long journey’s end without any accident from that hideous, screeching railway engine. Oh,
my Ellie! how shall I convey to thee an adequate idea of all that I suffered on the day of thy
departure? Though the storm has swept over me, and I seem quiet, yet thou art ever in my thoughts,
my dearest sister! Where now are the sounds of thy footsteps, and when shall I again hear them? At
midday and at eventide I listen for the pattering of thy little feet, and the sound of thy sweet
soft voice; but they break not upon my ear. At the accustomed time, I turn my eyes as though to see
thee come tripping up the dell, sometimes forgetting for the moment that thou art far away. My very
food has not the same sweet taste, as when thou wert there to partake of it with me. The golden blossom
of the gorse looks not so gay, nor the snowdrop so beautiful, as when plucked by thy hand. Dear sister,
you must bear with my selfish repinings for this once, hoping that by the time for another letter, I
shall be in a better frame of mind. Yes, Ellie, time is a wonderful healer. The case of our dear mother
was an instance of that; for see how we could sometimes sit and talk of her, as though we had never
mourned. It seems that while we were engaged with your wardrobe, father had arranged with Mr. Ollivar.
We are entirely clear of him as far as money matters go; but he is in the neighbourhood, and has been
up at the homestead, though father and he did not seem so easy and agreeable as before. He joked father
about being determined not to be obliged to him, congratulated him on having got this money, and very
politely pressed him to take some shares. But father said he had a use for the surplus, so Mr. Ollivar
said no more on that subject, but turned to me, and said I had almost lost my roses, and that I was not
to fret; for going away would ultimately be of great benefit to my sister. He pressed father to call
and see him at his house at D——, bringing me or any of the family. I observed that father did not as
usual say he would be glad to see him at any time when he was in the neighbourhood. To tell the truth,
I would much rather he did not come, although I know we are entirely out of his power. The children
have, as you will see, filled a half sheet of note paper, and have all kissed it a great many times.
You will see six drops of sealing-wax on the outside of the letter, which Mattie advised me to put, as
they signify kisses. The large one is from father, for we made him kiss last. How he did laugh!<br>

<em>Eleanor’s letter to Phœbe.</em><br>
</p>
<p>
“Dear Sister Phoebe,—You will no doubt be glad to hear that I continue to like school and my schoolfellows.
Indeed, I am as comfortable as any one can expect to be who was always so much attached to home. Mr.
Mildmay’s house, Luton Villa, is just on the outskirts of the town, and is surrounded by a beautiful
garden; and the offices for business are in the heart of the town. Luton Villa is not large, but very
comfortable, and it is presided over by Mr. Mildmay’s niece. A most excellent housekeeper she is, I
assure you. The old servant who filled that office while Miss Mildmay was at school still remains, and
gives her the benefit of her advice and assistance. Indeed, it is Mrs. Effie who has taught her everything
she knows in the cooking and housekeeping department. But in addition to being a good housewife, she is
a sweet-tempered and accomplished young lady, and devotedly attached to her uncle and sister; the latter,
you understand, being the young lady who is my schoolfellow; and she is also a very sweet girl. Our dear
brother George seems much respected by them all. The day after I arrived Mr. Mildmay drove himself and
niece out in their conveyance, and stipulated with Mrs. Hall that I was to accompany Emily to Luton Villa
every Friday evening, and remain until Monday morning. I like that arrangement very much; for I shall
have the society of my dear brother. But he is kept very close to business. Mr. Mildmay, though an old
gentleman with hair like silver, is quite at home with us young people. Indeed, one and all seem
determined to make me happy.<br>

“Dear Ellie,—After the hint dropped by father in his last, you will not be surprised to hear that we
have got our house done up; but I thought I would say nothing further till it was finished. Every room
in the house has been painted and papered, the beds and windows newly hung with beautiful damask or
dimity, and the floors covered with pretty new carpets. The walls of our staircase have all been
limewashed, and so beautifully done; not a scar or inequality to be seen from top to bottom, and the
contrast with the old oak doors and woodwork is perfection. The hall is bare, as it always was, for
what oilcloth could excel the beautiful stone floor of our hall and passages? Besides, father says
that whatever is laid upon stone in the way of covering, rots. Wallace has also got a new kennel.
Poor fellow! the old one was almost dropping to pieces about his ears. The outside of the house and
outhouses has been newly limewashed, and all the woodwork about our little estate has had three coats
of paint. Mattie is delighted, and goes on improving. You know she used to have some funny little
ways—the tattooing of pies and tarts with the dressing comb, to wit; but she gives way to me now
in almost everything. She was afraid I should overtax my strength; but the exercise has done me good,
and diverted my mind. Dear Nelly, I now only think of you in reference to the time when you will come
back and see our improvement. Mr. Ollivar is in the neighbourhood, and paid us a pop visit yesterday.
He paid me a great many compliments on the improvements made in the house, which he, in a great measure,
attributed to my taste. I somehow think he will not trouble us much more; for this last visit seemed
constrained. He caught me looking at him, and he soon took himself off; very much to my satisfaction,
and evidently as much to father’s. Indeed, I never saw him treat any one with such frigid politeness;
and you know, Ellie, that is not his way. As soon as we got all finished, I went down to mother’s grave,
and as might be expected after these refreshing showers, found the margin of grass encircling the tablet
growing very long and falling upon it; so, having taken the long scissors with me, I clipped it neatly
round, while pondering over the changes which have passed over us since our dear mother was laid under
it, and hoping that your visit would be the next.<br>

<em>Phoebe to Ellie.</em><br>
“Dear Ellie,—Although it is just a fortnight since I wrote my last long letter, I feel quite inclined
to begin again, knowing that, however trivial its contents may seem to another, they will always be of
interest to you. Father took me with him last week to pay all the bills that have been contracted for
the doing up of the house, and we bought the children straw hats, which I have been trimming myself.
Although we have now got a comfortable house, and all is paid for, I must not forget to be careful.
Neither do I. While the borrowed money has been paid, and our house renovated, I know that father has
the same amount of interest to pay Mr. Williamson that he had to pay Mr. Leonard before mother died.
What a fortunate thing it was that Mr. Williamson got that money left him just when father needed it!
I am now very busy with frocks, mantles, etc., for the summer; and am cutting, fitting, and making
them myself. So you see, Ellie, I have plenty of business on hand one way and another. Father has got
a half-worn suit of his own made up for poor Robin to go to church in; and I assure you he does look
decent in it. He has also given Roger a suit. You see, Ellie, I try to remember every little thing that
may interest you. By-the-bye, Mattie tells me Mrs. Simmons has had a grand rout, and who do you think
should be there but Mr. Ollivar! There’s one blessing, they did not send to our house for anything to
furnish their entertainment; so I sincerely hope we have got that leakage stopped. Dear Ellie, I cannot
account for it, but I have been thinking a great deal about mother lately. Yes, dear, I sometimes sit
down near her tomb, and almost fancy that if she were seating herself beside me, I should not be afraid;
and, naughty, wicked girl that I am, when sitting in our renovated house, I have almost wished her
back from her blest abode, that she might see how comfortable we are. Yet, what is the best house in
the world compared to her habitation? And how her sensitive mind would, in the meantime, have suffered
by witnessing our little privations.”
