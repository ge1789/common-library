<!-- chapter titled "A Daughter of the Muhammadans: A Study from the Life" -->
<!-- poetic quotation -->
<p>The sunset hour had come as I passed up the narrow track that skirted the river bank, with a mob of villagers at my heels, old men who had seen many strange things in the wild days before the coming of the White Men, dull peasants who seemed too stolid and stupid to have ever seen anything at all, and swaggering youngsters, grown learned in the mysteries of reading and writing, fresh from our schools, and prepared at a moment’s notice to teach the wisest of the village elders the only proper manner in which an egg may be sucked. The rabble which every Malay village spews up nowadays, when one chances to visit it, is always composed of these elements, the old men whose wisdom is their own, and of its kind deep and wide; the middle-aged tillers of the soil who have no wisdom and desire none; the men of the younger generation whose knowledge is borrowed and is extraordinarily imperfect of its kind.</p>
<p>The glaring Eastern sun, sinking to its rest, blazed full in my eyes, dazzling me, and thus I saw but dimly the figure that crossed the path in front of me, heading for the running water on my right. Silhouetted blackly against the burning disc in the West, it appeared to be the form of a woman, bowed nearly double beneath the weight of a burden slung in a cloth across her back—a burden far too heavy for her strength. This, alas! is a sight only too common in Asiatic lands; for if man must idle, woman must work as well as weep, until at last the time comes for the long, long sleep, under the spear-blades of the <i>lâlang</i> and the love-grass, in some shady nook in the little, peaceful village burial-ground. Therefore, I took no special notice of the figure moving painfully athwart the sun-glare ahead of me, until my arm was violently seized by the Headman, who was walking just behind me.</p>
<p>‘Have a care, <i>Tûan</i>,’ he cried. ‘Have a care. It is Mînah and her man. It is the sickness that is not good, the evil sickness. Go not nigh to her, <i>Tûan</i>, lest some ill thing befall.’</p>
<p>The instinct of the White Man always bids him promptly disregard every warning that a native may give to him, and act in a manner diametrically opposed to that which a native may advise. This propensity has added considerably to the figures that represent the European death-rate throughout Asia, and incidentally, it has led to many of the acts of heroism which have won for Englishmen their Eastern Empire. It has also set the native the hard task of deciding whether he is most astonished at the courage or the stupidity of the men who rule him. I have lived long enough among natives to know that there is generally a sound reason for any warnings that they may be moved to give; but Nature, as usual, was stronger than common sense, so I shook my arm free from the Headman’s grip, and walked up to the figure in front of me.</p>
<p>It was, as I had seen, that of a woman, bowed beneath a heavy burden, a woman still young, not ill-looking, and with the truest, most tenderly feminine eyes that I think I have ever chanced upon. I only noticed this later, and perhaps a knowledge of her story helped then to quicken my perceptions—but at the moment my attention was completely absorbed by the strange bundle which she bore. It was a shapeless thing, wrapped in an old cloth, soiled and tattered and horribly stained, which was slung over the woman’s left shoulder, across her breast, and under her right armpit. Out of the bundle, just above the base of the woman’s own neck, there protruded a head which lolled backwards as she moved, grey-white in colour, hairless, sightless, featureless, formless, an object of horror and repulsion. Near her shoulders two stumps, armed with ugly bosses at their tips, protruded from the bundle, motiveless limbs that swayed and gesticulated loosely; near her own hips two similar members hung down almost to the ground, dangling limply as the woman walked—limbs that showed grey in the evening light, and ended in five whitish patches where the toes should have been. It was a leper far gone in the disease whom the woman was carrying riverwards. She did not pause when I spoke to her, rather she seemed to quicken her pace, and presently she and her burden, the shapeless head and limbs of the latter bobbing impotently as the jolts shook them, disappeared down the shelving bank in the direction of the running water.</p>
<p>I stood still where she had left me, horrified at what I had seen, for lepers or indeed deformed people of any kind, are remarkably rare among the healthy Malay villagers, and the unexpected encounter had shocked and sickened me. Of the men in the group behind me, some laughed, one or two uttered a few words of cheap jeer and taunt, everyone of them turned aside to spit solemnly in token that some unclean thing had been at hand, and the Headman, newly appointed and weighed upon by the sense of his responsibilities, whispered an apology in my ear.</p>
<p>‘Thy pardon, <i>Tûan</i>,’ he said. ”Tis an ill-omened sight, and verily I crave thy forgiveness. It is not fitting that she should thus pass and repass athwart the track, walked in by such as thou art, bearing so unworthy a load. I hope that thou wilt pardon her and the village. Truly she is a bad woman to bring this shame upon our folk.’</p>
<p>‘Who is she?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘She is a woman of this village, one devoid of shame. And behold, this day she hath smudged soot upon the faces of all our folk by thus wantonly passing across thy path with her man, the leper, and presently I will upbraid her—yea, verily I will upbraid her with pungent words!’</p>
<p>‘Is she also unclean?’ I asked.</p>
‘No, <i>Tûan</i>, the evil sickness hath not fallen upon her—yet. But her man is sore stricken, and though we, who are of her blood, plead with her unceasingly, bidding her quit this man, as by Muhammad’s Law she hath the right now to do, she will by no means hearken to our words, for, <i>Tûan</i>, she is a woman of a hard and evil heart, very obstinate and headstrong.’</p>
<p>He spoke quite simply the thought that was in his mind. In his eyes there was nothing of heroism, nothing of the glory of most tender womanhood, in the sight of this girl’s self-sacrifice; to him and to his fellows her conduct was merely a piece of rank folly, the wanton whim of a woman, deaf to the pleadings and persuasions of those who wished her well. He had even less sympathy with me when, regarding the matter from my own point of view, I spoke to him in her praise.</p>
<p>‘Of a truth,’ I said, ‘this woman of thy village is greater than any of her kind of whom I have heard tell in all this land of Pahang. Thy village, O Penghûlu, hath a right to be proud of this leper’s wife. I charge thee say no word of reproach to her concerning the crossing of my path, and give her this—’tis but a small sum—and tell her that it is given in token of the honour in which I hold her.’</p>
<p>This unexpected way of regarding a matter which had long been a topic of conversation in the village, was altogether unintelligible to the Malays about me, but most of them had long ago abandoned the task of trying to understand the strange motions of the European mind, an effort which, they had become convinced, was hopeless. Money, however, is a valuable and honourable commodity, and whatever else he may fail to appreciate, this is a matter well within the comprehension of the Malay of every class. Even in the minds of the simplest villagers, the possession of anything which is likely to bring in cash inspires something near akin to awe, and, therefore, my small gift had the effect of immediately drying up the undercurrent of taunts and jeers at the expense of Mînah and her husband which had been audible among the Headman’s followers ever since the strange pair had come into view. Moreover, as I knew full well, the fact that I had spoken of her with words of praise, and had backed my remarks with silver, would do much to increase the importance, and add to the consideration shown to this brave wife by the people among whom she lived.</p>
<p>‘Tell her also,’ I said, as I got into my boat to begin the journey down stream. ‘Tell her also that if there be aught in which she standeth in need of my aid, now or hereafter, she hath but to come to me, or to send me word, and I will help her in her affliction according to the measure of my ability.’</p>
<p>‘<i>Tûan</i>!’ cried an assenting chorus of villagers, as my boat pushed out from the bank, and my men seized their paddles for the homeward row; and thus ended my first encounter with Mînah, the woman of the Muhammadans, whom neither the threats of the village elders, the advice of her relations, the tears and entreaties of her sisters, nor the invitations of those who would have wed with her, had power to lure away from the side of the shapeless wreck of humanity whom she called husband.</p>
<!-- blank line in the original -->
<p>Later, I made it my business to inquire from those who knew concerning this woman and her circumstances, and all that I learned tended to increase the admiration which from the beginning I had felt for her.</p>
<p>Like all Malay women, she had been married when hardly more than a child to a man whom she had barely seen, and with whom, prior to her wedding, she would not for her life have been guilty of the indecency of speaking a syllable. On a certain day she had been decked out in all the finery and gold ornaments that her people could borrow from their neighbours for many miles around, had been placed upon a dais, side by side with the man she was to wed, and had remained there in an agony of cramped limbs and painful embarrassment while the village folk—who represented all the world of which she had any knowledge—ate their fill of the rich viands set before them, and thereafter chanted discordantly many verses from the Kurân in sadly mispronounced Arabic. This terrible publicity, for one who had hitherto been kept in utter seclusion on the <i>pâra</i>, or shelf-like upper apartment, of her father’s house, almost deprived the dazed little girl of her faculties, and she had been too abjectly frightened even to cry, far less to lift her eyes from her scarlet finger-tips, on which the henna showed like blood-stains, to steal a glimpse of the man to whose tender mercies her parents were surrendering her.</p>
<p>Then, the wedding over with all its attendant ceremonies, for days she had been utterly miserable. She was horribly afraid of her new lord, terrified almost to death, like a little bird in the hand of its captor. To this poor child, not yet in her ‘teens,’ a man and a stranger was much what the ogre of the fairy-tales is to the imagination of other little girls of about the same age in our nurseries at home—a creature all-powerful, cruel, relentless, against whose monstrous strength her puny efforts at resistance could nought avail. All women who are wives by contract, rather than by inclination, experience something of this agony of fear when first they find themselves at the mercy of a man; but for the girls of a Muhammadan population this instinctive dread of the husband has a ten-fold force. During all the days of her life the woman of the Muhammadans has seen the power of the man undisputed and unchecked by the female members of his household; she has seen, perhaps, her own mother put away, after many years of faithfulness and love, because her charms have faded, and her lord has grown weary of her; she has seen the married women about her cowed by a word, or even a look, from the man who holds in his hands an absolute right to dispose of his wife’s destiny; she has watched the men eating their meals apart—alone, if no other member of the masculine sex chanced to be present—because, forsooth, women are deemed to be unworthy to partake of food with their superiors; and, as a result of all these things, the woman of the Muhammadans has learned to believe from her heart that, in truth, man is fashioned in a mould more honourable than that in which the paltry folk of her own sex are cast, that he is indeed nobler, higher, greater in every way than woman, and thus as she looks ever upwards to him the man dazzles her, and fills her simple, trustful soul with fear and awe.</p>
<p>So poor little Mînah had been frightened out of her wits by the bare thought of being handed over to a husband for his service and pleasure, and her gratitude to her man had been extravagant and passionate in its intensity when she found that he was unchangingly kind and tender to her. For Mâmat, the man to whom this poor child had been so early mated, was a gentle, kind-hearted, tender-mannered fellow, a typical villager of the interior, lazy, indolent and pleasure-loving, but courteous of manner, soft of speech, and caressing by instinct, as are so many folk of the kindly Malayan stock. He, too, perhaps, had been moved with pity for the wild-eyed little girl, who trembled when she addressed him in quavering monosyllables, and he found a new pleasure in soothing and petting her. And thus, little by little, his almost paternal feeling for his child-wife turned in due season to a man’s strong love, and awoke in her breast a woman’s passionate and enthusiastic devotion. So Mâmat and Mînah were happy for a space, although no children were born to them, and Mînah fretted secretly, when the hut was still at night-time, for she knew that there was truth in what the women of the village whispered, saying that no wife might hope to hold the fickle heart of a man unless there were baby fingers to add their clutching grip to her own desperate but feeble graspings.</p>
<p>Two or three seasons had come and gone since the Feast of the Becoming One had joined Mâmat and Mînah together as man and wife. The rich yellow crop in the rice field had been reaped laboriously ear by ear, and the good grain had been garnered. The ploughs had been set agoing once more across the dry meadows, and in the swamps the buffaloes had been made to dance clumsily by yelling, sweating men, until the soft earth had been kneaded into a quagmire. Then the planting had begun, and later, all the village had marked with intense interest the growth and the development of the crop, till once more the time had arrived for the reaping, and again the ugly bark rice-stores were full to overflowing with fat, yellow grain. Mînah and Mâmat had aided in the work of cultivation, and had watched Nature giving birth to her myriad offspring with unfailing regularity, and still no little feet pattered over the lath flooring of their hut, no little voice made merry music in their compound. Mâmat seemed to have become more melancholy than of old, and he frequently returned from the fields complaining of fever, and lay down to rest, tired and depressed. Mînah tended him carefully, with gentle, loving hands, but she told herself that the day was drawing near which would bring the co-wife who should bear sons to her husband, to oust her from Mâmat’s heart. Therefore, when her man was absent, she would weep furtively as she sat alone among the cooking-pots in the empty hut, and many were the vows of rich offerings to be devoted to the shrines of the local saints if only the joy of motherhood might be hers.</p>
<p>One afternoon Mâmat came back to the hut, and as was his wont, for he was ever tender to his childless wife, and anxious to aid her in her work, he fell to boiling water at the little mud fireplace at the back of the central living-room, where Mînah was cooking the evening meal. While he was so engaged his masculine fingers touched the pot clumsily, causing it to tip off the iron tripod upon which it had been resting. The boiling water streamed over the fingers of his right hand, and Mînah screamed shrilly in sympathy for the pain which she knew he must be enduring; but Mâmat looked up at her with wondering eyes.</p>
<p>‘What ails thee, little one?’ he asked, without a trace of suffering in his voice.</p>
<p>‘The water is boiling hot,’ cried Mînah. ‘<i>Ya Allah!</i> How evil is my destiny that because, unlike other men, thou would’st stoop to aid me in my work, so great a hurt hath befallen thee! Oh, Weh, Weh, my heart is very sad because this trouble hath come to thee. Let me bind thy fingers; see, here is oil and much rag, clean and soft.’</p>
<p>‘What ails thee, little one?’ Mâmat asked again, staring at her uncomprehendingly. ‘I have suffered no hurt, the water was cold. See, I am unharmed. Look at my fing—’</p>
<p>His voice faltered, then his speech broke off, trailing away into inarticulate sounds, while he sat staring stupidly in mingled astonishment and fear at his scalded hands. The little hut was reeking with the odour sent up by that peeling skin and flesh.</p>
<p>‘What thing is this, Mînah?’ he asked presently, in an awed whisper. ‘What thing is this? For in truth I felt no pain, and even now, though for certain the water is boiling, since my fingers are all a-frizzle, no pang hath come to me. What is it, Mînah?’</p>
<p>Mînah looked at the ugly hand her husband held out for her inspection, and she was as bewildered as he. ‘Perchance ‘tis some magic which thou hast learned that maketh the fire powerless to harm thee,’ she said simply.</p>
<p>Magic is too common and every-day a thing in the Malay Peninsula, for either Mînah or Mâmat to see anything extravagant in the idea. Mâmat, indeed, felt rather flattered by the suggestion, but none the less, he denied having any dealings with the spirits, and for some weeks he thought little more about the discovery of his strange insensibility to pain. The sores on his hands, however, did not heal, and at length matters began to look serious, since he could no longer do his proper share of work in the fields. By Mînah’s advice the aid of a local medicine man of some repute was had recourse to, and for days the little house was noisy with the sound of old-world incantations, and redolent of heavy odours arising from the strange spices burning in the wizard’s brazier. Mâmat, too, went abroad with his hands stained all manner of unnatural hues, and was deprived of most of the few things which render his rice palatable to an up-country Malay.</p>
<p>For some weeks, as is the manner of his kind, both in Europe and Asia, the medicine man struggled with the disease he half recognised, but lacked the courage to name; and when at length disguise was no longer possible, it was to Mînah that he told the truth, told it with the crude and brutal bluntness which natives, and country folk all the world over, keep for the breaking of ill tidings. He lay in wait for her by the little bathing-hut on the river bank, where Mînah was won’t to fill the gourds with water for her house, and he began his tale at once, without preface or preparation.</p>
<p>‘Sister, it is the evil sickness,’ he said. ‘Without doubt it is the sickness that is not good. For me, I can do nought to aid this man of thine; wherefore, give me the money that is due to me, and suffer me to depart, for I also greatly fear to contract the evil. And, sister, it were well for thee to make shift to seek a divorce from Mâmat speedily, as is permitted in such cases by the law, lest thou in like manner become afflicted with the sickness, for this evil is one that can in no wise be medicined, even if <i>Petera Gûru</i> himself were to take a hand in the charming away of the bad humours.’</p>
<p>No one in Asia ever names leprosy. It is spoken of but rarely, and then by all manner of euphonisms, lest hearing its name pronounced, it should seek out the speaker and abide with him for ever. But when the words ‘the evil sickness’ sounded in her ears, Mînah understood, with a violent shock of most complete comprehension; and, alas for frail human nature, her first thought was for herself, for it sent a throb of relief, almost of joy, pulsing through her. Her man was a leper! No woman would now be found to wed with him; no co-wife would come into her life to separate her from her husband; barren and childless though she be, the man she loved would be hers for all his days, and no one would arise to dispute her right, her sole right, to love and tend and cherish him. The medicine man turned away, and walked slowly up the path by the river bank, counting the coppers in his hand, and she stood where he had left her, gazing after him, a prey to a number of conflicting emotions. Then a realisation of the pity of it overwhelmed her—a yearning, aching pity for the man she loved—and in an agony of self-reproach, she threw herself face downward on the ground, among the warm, damp grasses, and prayed passionately and inarticulately, prayed to the Leprosy itself, as though it were a sentient being, entreating it, if indeed it must have a victim, to take her and to spare her husband. She had not been taught, as Christian women are, to turn to God in the hour of her despair; and though she breathed out prayer and plaint, as she lay upon the damp earth and tore at the lush grass, her thoughts were never for a moment directed heavenwards. She was a woman of the Muhammadans, unskilled in letters, ignorant utterly of the teachings of her faith, and like all her people, she was a Malay first, and a follower of the Prophet accidentally, and, as it were, by an afterthought. Therefore, her cry was raised to the demon of Leprosy, to the spirits of wind and air, and to all manner of unclean creatures who should find no place in the mythology of a true believer. The old-world superstitions, the natural religion of the Malays before ever the Arab missionaries came to tamper with their simple paganism, always come uppermost in the native mind in time of stress or trouble, just as it is the natural man—the savage—that rises to the surface, through no matter what superimposed strata of conventionalism, in moments of strong emotion. But these things had power to help Mînah but little, and to comfort her not at all, and any strength that she gained during that hour which she spent prone, in agony, and alone, came to her from her own brave and tender heart, that fountain of willing self-sacrifice and unutterable tenderness, the heart of a good and pure woman.</p>
<p>The evening sun was sinking redly when at last Mînah gathered herself together, rearranged her tumbled hair and crumpled garments with deft, feminine fingers, and turned her face towards her home. Later still, when the moon had risen and was pouring down its floods of pure light, softening and etherealising all upon which it shone, and penetrating the chinks of the wattled walls in little jets and splashes of brightness, Mînah, tenderly caressing the head of her husband, which lay pillowed on her breast, whispered in his ears the words which revealed to him the full measure of his calamity. No more awful message can come to any man than that which makes known to him that he has been stricken by leprosy, that foulest, most repulsive, and least merciful of all incurable diseases; and Mâmat, as he listened to his wife’s whispered speech, cowered and trembled in the semi-darkness of the hut, and now and again, as he rocked his body to and fro, to and fro restlessly, he gave vent to a low sob of concentrated pain very pitiful to hear. Leprosy has a strange power to blight a man utterly, to rob him alike of the health and the cleanliness of his body, and of the love which has made life sweet to him; for when the terror falls upon anyone, even those who loved him best in the days when he was whole, too often turn from him in loathing and fear. As slowly and with pain, Mâmat began to understand clearly, and, understanding, to realise the full meaning of the words that fell from his wife’s lips, he drew hurriedly away from her, despite her restraining hands, and sat huddled up in a corner of the hut, weeping the hard, deep-drawn tears that come to a grown man in the hour of his trial, bringing no relief, but merely adding one pang more to the intensity of his suffering. Vaguely he told himself that since Mînah must be filled with horror at his lightest touch, since she would now surely leave him, as she had a right to do, he owed it to himself, and to what little remnant of self-respect was left to him, that the first signal for withdrawal should be made by him. It would help to ease the path which she must tread, the path that was to lead her away from him for ever, if from the beginning he showed her plainly that he expected nothing but desertion, that she was free to go, to leave him, that he was fully prepared for the words that should tell him of her intention, though for the moment they still remained unspoken. Therefore, though Mînah drew near to him, he repulsed her gently, and retired yet further into the depths of the shadows, saying warningly,—</p>
<p>‘Have a care, lest thou also becomest infected with the evil.’</p>
<p>Again Mînah moved towards him, with arms outstretched as though to embrace him, and again he evaded her. A little moonbeam, struggling through the interstices of the wattled walls, fell full upon her face, and revealed to him her eyes dewy with tears and yearning upon him with a great love. The sight was so unexpected that it came to him with the violence of a blow, sending a strange thrill through all his ruined body, and tightening something that seemed to grip his heart, so that he panted for breath like one distressed with running.</p>
<p>‘Have a care!’ he cried again, but Mînah took no heed of this warning.</p>
<p>‘What care I?’ she cried. ‘What care I? Thinkest thou that my love is so slight a thing that it will cleave to thee only in the days of thy prosperity? Am I like unto a woman of the town, one who loveth only when all be well, and the silver dollars be many and bright? Am I such an one who hath no care save only for herself? O Mâmat, my man of mine! After these years that we have lived together in love, dost thou know me so little? me, thy wife, that thou thinkest that I will willingly leave thee because, forsooth, the evil spirits have caused this trouble to befall thee? Weh, I love thee, I love thee, I love thee, and in truth I cannot live without thee! Come to me, Weh, come to me.’ And again she held out her arms towards him, entreating tenderly.</p>
<p>For long Mâmat resisted, fighting against the temptation sturdily for the sake of the love that he bore her, but at length the longing for human sympathy, and for comfort in his great affliction,—a desire which, in time of trouble, a man feels as instinctively as does the little child that, having come by some hurt, runs to its mother to be petted into forgetfulness of the pain,—proved too strong for him, and he sank down, sobbing unrestrainedly, with his head in Mînah’s lap, and her soft hands fondling and caressing him.</p>
<p>And thus it came about that Mînah made the great sacrifice, which, in a manner, was to her no sacrifice, and her husband brought himself to accept what to him was more precious than anything upon earth.</p>

<p>Two or three years slid by after this, and as Mînah watched her husband, she marked the subtle changes of the evil to which he was a prey, working their cruel will upon him. He had been far gone in the disease, even before the medicine man had mustered courage to name it, but for many months after the discovery, little change was noticeable. Then, as is its wont, the leprosy, as though ashamed of such prolonged inactivity, took a stride forward, then halted again, then advanced once more, but this time with more lagging feet, then came to a standstill for a space, then moved onward yet again. Thus, though the alterations wrought by the ravages of the disease were cruel and terrible, to Mînah, who marked each change take place gradually, step by step, beneath her eyes, underlying the grey, featureless face, in the blind eye-sockets, the aimless, swaying limbs that were now mere stumps, she saw as clearly as of old the face, the glance, the gestures that had been those of her husband, and seeing them, she loved this formless thing with the old passion of devotion and tenderness. He was utterly dependent on her now. Twice daily she bore him on her back down to the river’s edge, and bathed him with infinite care. To her there seemed nothing remarkable in the act. She had done it for the first time one day long ago when his feet were peculiarly sore and uncomfortable, had done it laughing, half in jest, and he had laughed too, joining in her merriment. But now it was the only means of conveying him riverwards, and she carried him on her back unthinkingly, as a matter of course. In the same way she had come to dress and feed him, first half laughingly, before there was any real necessity for such help, but latterly his limbs had grown to be so useless, that without her aid he would have gone naked and have died of starvation. Allah or the Spirits—Mînah was never sure which of the two had the larger share in the arrangements of her world—had not seen fit to send her a child in answer to her prayer, but she never lamented the fact now. Was not Mâmat husband and child in one? And did she not empty all the stores of her love, both wifely and maternal, upon him, who needed her more sorely than a baby could have done, and loved her with the strength of a man and the simplicity of a trusting child? All the womanliness in her nature, purified and deepened by her sad experience, rose up in the heart of this daughter of the Muhammadans, fortifying her in trial, blinding her to the nobility of her own self-sacrifice, obliterating all thought of self, filling her with a great content, and making the squalor of her life a thing most beautiful. And she had to work for both her husband and herself, that there might be rice for them to eat and clothing for their bodies, so her labours were never ended. But the kindly villagers who pitied her, though they could not repress an occasional jeer at her eccentric devotion to a leper, lightened her tasks for her in a thousand ways, so that she found her fields tilled, her crops weeded, and the precious grain stored safely, without clearly knowing how the necessary work had been performed at such slight cost to herself. And thus Mînah and her man spent many years of the life which even the Demon of Leprosy had been powerless to rob of all its sweetness.</p>
<!-- blank line in the original -->
<p>It was some years after the White Men had entered Pahang for the purpose of quieting the troubled land, that a new terror came to Mînah, tightening her heart-strings with an anxiety hitherto undreamed of. Men whispered in the villages that the strange, pale-faced folk who now ruled the land, had many laws unknown to the old Râjas, laws unhallowed by custom—the greatest of Malayan fetishes—not endeared to the people by age or tradition, and that one of these provided for the segregation of lepers. Mînah listened, dumb with misery, as the village elders, mumbling their discontent concerning a thousand lying rumours, spoke also of this measure as likely to become law in Pahang. The wanton cruelty of the notion was what chiefly struck her. The old native rulers had been oppressive, with hearts like flint and hands of crushing weight, but they had always had a personal motive for their acts, a motive which their people recognised and understood. But what good purpose, she asked herself, could be served by robbing her of her man? What gratification could the White Folk derive from such an aimless piece of barbarity? In imagination she seemed to hear his fretful call, his mumbled speech, which none but she could interpret or understand, and the thought of the pitifulness of his condition, if deprived of her love and companionship, came upon her with a sickening pang of dismay, filling her with fear, yet nerving her to fight to the death to save him from this bitter wrong, to fight as does the tigress in defence of her little ones.</p>
<p>Mînah managed with difficulty to persuade and bribe an old crone to tend Mâmat for a day or two. Then she set off for Kuâla Lipis, the town at which, she had heard men say, the White Men had their headquarters. Until she started upon this journey, she had never left her own village, and to her the twenty odd miles of river, that separated her home from the town, were a road of wonder through an undiscovered country. The ordered streets; the brick buildings, in which the Chinese traders had their shops; the lampposts; the native policemen standing at the corners of the road—shameless folk who wore trousers, but no protecting <i>sârong</i>—the vast block of Government buildings, for to her this far from imposing pile seemed a stupendous piece of architecture; the made roads, smooth and metalled; the wonder and the strangeness of it all dazed and frightened her. What could the White Men, who had so many marvellous things, want with her poor man, the leper, that they should desire to take him from her? Ah, it was cruel, cruel, more merciless and wanton than any of the deeds of the old Rajas, concerning which men still told grisly tales with bated breath.</p>
<p>She asked for me, since I had bade her come to me in trouble, and presently she made her way along the unfamiliar roads to the big house on the river bank, round which the forest clustered so closely in the beauty that no hand is suffered to destroy. She sat upon the matting on my study floor, awed at the strangeness of it all, looking at me plaintively out of those great eyes of hers, and weeping furtively. She had the simple faith of one who has lived all his days in the same spot, whither few strangers go, where each man knows his neighbour and his neighbour’s affairs. It never occurred to her that her words might need explanation or preface of any kind, in order that they might be rendered intelligible, and as she looked at me, she sobbed out her prayer, ‘O suffer me to keep my man and my children; O suffer them not to be taken from me! <i>Allah, Tûan</i>, suffer me to keep my man and my children!’</p>
<p>I knew, of course, that she spoke of her ‘man and her children’ simply for the sake of decorum, since it is coarse and indecent, in the eyes of an up-country woman, to speak of her husband alone, even though she be childless, but, for the moment, I supposed that she was the wife of some man accused of a crime, who had come to me seeking the aid I had not the power to give.</p>
<p>‘What has thy man done?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Done, <i>Tûan</i>? What could he do, seeing that he is as one dead? Unless men lifted him he could not move. But suffer him not to be taken from me. He is all I have; all I have, and in truth I cannot live without him. I shall die, <i>Tûan</i>, I shall die, if thou dost suffer this thing to come to pass.’</p>
<p>Then suddenly the mist obscuring my memory rolled away, and I saw the face of this woman as I had seen it once before, straining under a terrible burden on the banks of the Jelai River, with the red sky and the dark green of the foliage making a background against which it stood revealed. Then at last I understood, and the sight of her distress moved me strangely.</p>
<p>‘Have no fear, sister,’ I said. ‘Thy man shall not be taken from thee if I can do ought to prevent it. Who is it that seeks to separate thee from him?’</p>
<p>‘Men say it is an order.’ To the Oriental an order is a kind of impersonal monster, invincible and impartial, a creature that respects no man, and is cruel to all alike.</p>
<p>‘Have no fear,’ I said. ‘It is true that I have bidden the Headmen of the villages report as to the number of those afflicted by the evil sickness, but only with a view to aiding those who suffer. Moreover, in this land of Pahang, the number is very small, and the infection seemingly doth not spread. Therefore, sister, have no fear, and believe me, come what may, the Government will not separate thee from thy man. Return now in peace to thy home, and put all trouble from thee, and if aught cometh to sorrow thee, remember that I am ever at hand to listen to thy plaint.’</p>
<p>As I finished speaking, the woman before me was transformed. Her great faithful eyes were filled with tears, her brown skin faded suddenly to a dull grey with the intensity of her emotions, and before I could stay her, she had thrown herself full length upon the matting at my feet, encircling them with her warm grasp. I leapt up, humbled exceedingly that such a woman should so abase herself before me, and angered by an Englishman’s instinctive hatred of a scene, and as I tore myself away from her I heard her say almost in a whisper, ‘Thy servant hath little skill in speech, but in truth, <i>Tûan</i>, thou hast made me happy—happy as a barren wife to whom it is given to bear a son!’ And as I looked into her face it seemed to me to shine with the beauty of her soul.</p>

<p>So Mînah returned to her home with joy in her heart and that glad look upon her face, and in that secluded up-country village, not twenty miles from the place where I sat writing her history, she still toils unceasingly tending the wrecked creature, that even yet is to her the man she loves, with unfailing tenderness and care. Men say that he can live but a few months longer, and it wrings my heart to think of what the loss will be to Mînah when, to use the Malayan idiom, ‘the order comes’ to her man. In that hour of utter desolation and profound loneliness, no human voice will have the power to bring that beautiful look to Mînah’s eyes, and of a Divine Voice this Daughter of the Muhammadans, in spite of her pure soul and her brave heart, has no knowledge from which to seek consolation.</p>
