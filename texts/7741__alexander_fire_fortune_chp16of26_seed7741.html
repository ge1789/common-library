<meta charset="utf-8">

<!--CHAPTER XVI-->
<p>Trevelyan sat writing diligently. He was doing a piece of dry work to order; nevertheless, it interested him. His imagination could always present him with vivid pictures of what he wished, or anticipated, or attempted to create, but this ” search-light” was projected by a solid machinery of common-sense and experience which kept him within the limits of possibility, and enabled him to enjoy the flavour of facts.</p>

<p>At times, however, he paused, the pen between his fingers, yielding to the overpowering inclination to close his eyes and see over again the face and figure of Miss fitzalan. He was proud of his own strength and prudence in resisting the temptation to call and discuss the play with her, or repeat his visit to the theatre. The effect she produced upon him was unaccountably vivid. Her voice had a wonderful charm for him; her simplicity and youthfulness touched his heart. He realised her loneliness and defencelessness; but since he had seen her act in that love scene a curious glow, a subtle electric flame began to quiver through his veins whenever her image flitted across his mental field of vision. How deliciously, how tenderly, she could love! How lovely she could make life—at all events for a time! He was rather ashamed of these thoughts. It was contemptibly weak to give way to them. She was so sweet, so frank, he would not think of her for a moment save with sincere respect. Yet to make her his wife was impossible. He was much too poor to dream of matrimony, a holy state which did not attract him; and the last woman he should wish to marry was an actress. Not that he doubted that among actresses plenty of excellent women were to be found; but he hated the whole thing with something of the haughty exclusiveness which once characterised him. Men were all right upon the stage, but he somehow did not like it for women, at any rate, his own women. No, he would be guided by reason, and avoid the little syren who attracted him, especially as he felt that, though probably she was unaware of it herself, she was in strong sympathy with him. He had hardly arrived at this sensible resolution when Captain Herbert walked in unceremoniously.</p>

<p>“If my interruption is very objectionable, Trev., tell me to ‘get out.’”</p>

<p>“No, you can stay. I have done enough, for my attention is beginning to wander. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing very particular. I am now a gentleman at large, which I do not exactly like. I miss the regiment awfully, and now, as my uncle has paid my debts, or thinks he has, he considers I’m bound to act nurse. It is not an enlivening occupation. He is infernally cantankerous, but I must not say strait-laced. Now he wants to marry me to Lady Sarah Chillingham; she has a big fortune, you know. I don’t object to that; but do you know her?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t go much into society.”</p>

<p>“If you did, you would agree with me that she must have been born on an iceberg and educated in a refrigerator. It’s particularly hard, because, just at present, I’m all <i>a-glowing</i> and a-blowing in a different direction. I cannot contradict Lord Ellersdale straight out, for you know he has a lot of personal property, savings, etc., he can will away from me. Besides, when he paid up my recent debts he didn’t know there was a thick substratum of old ones. The original creditors are very unreasonably jealous of the more modern sufferers, and so, Trev., my boy, as men who have been slave-raiding and diamond-stealing in South Africa generally return with plethoric pockets, will you lend me a couple of thou, that I may throw sops to the most voracious of the sharks?”</p>

<p>Trevelyan laughed.</p>

<p>“No, my dear fellow,” he returned good-humouredly. “I don’t possess more <i>pour tout potage</i>, and I cannot do without it.”</p>

<p>” ‘Pon my soul, you are confoundedly disobliging! Look here! I’ll give you fifty per cent.”</p>

<p>“It’s a tempting speculation, but I cannot afford it. I should think you could easily get what you want at that rate. Every one knows you are heir to the Ellersdale estates though the title drops.” </p>

<p>“Of course they do; but they also know that it is possible an heir in the male line may turn up. They say that Lord Ellersdale’s next brother left a son or grandson out in India or California.”</p>

<p>“It is highly improbable that he should put in an appearance.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, you will not lend the the cash?”</p>

<p>“No, Herbert, I am sorry I cannot.” </p>

<p>“Well, that’s settled! Perhaps you’ll do me a smaller service. I hear the Hammonds’ Sunday evening gatherings are most amusing. You have the <i>entrée</i> of the house. Take me with you next Sunday.”</p>

<p>“I did not intend going next Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s intolerable; after giving me such a face, you should at least throw me some crumb of comfort!”</p>

<p>“It’s rather an amusing house, but I do not care to go often.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! nonsense. You do not want to give me the chance of a chat with our charming little friend, Miss fitzalan.”</p>

<p>“Why should I object, and why do you want to cultivate her when you contemplate matrimony?”</p>

<p>“What on earth has matrimony to do with a pretty little sentimental idyll?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a dog in the manger, old boy.”</p>

<p>“That is not my failing.” A rapid flash of thought told him that he must not pose as a prig. “Well, Herbert, so be it. I’ll chaperon you to Mrs Hammond’s on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“All right. Come and dine with me at eight, or rather, with my uncle. Do you know the poor old boy has dragged himself up to town, and is installed in Portman Square—to look after my affairs, I believe.”</p>

<p>“What a mark of interest and affection,” exclaimed Trevelyan</p>.

<p>“He generally manages a few months in town,” was the rejoinder. “It is desperately cold at Ellersdale in early spring. You’ll dine with us, I hope. He begged me to catch you as often as I could.” </p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll come, with pleasure. Lord Ellersdale is a capital host.”</p>

<p>Mrs Hammond’s drawing-rooms were fuller than usual when Miss Delamere, with Staunton in attendance, entered. He had been rather a tax upon her since Cara’s <i>début</i>, and she began to reflect how she could turn him to account and dismiss him, especially as her manager talked of discontinuing <i>The Queen’s Vengeance</i> in London and taking it on tour. She was vaguely uneasy and infinitely surprised, not to say indignant, at Miss fitzalan’s success. This feeling was sharpened by Staunton’s report that his bracelet had been rejected. She had suggested that it might be given into her safe keeping; but Staunton very coolly informed her that he intended to keep it himself.</p>

<p>“What airs to give herself!” she exclaimed viciously; “and only the other day she was but a little maid-of-all-work who might be sent to scrub the floor!”</p>

<p>“She would have done it very well, too,” returned Staunton stolidly.</p>

<p>Miss Delamere felt there was little use bom- barding earthworks, and so recovered herself, and proceeded to give him sage advice as to how he could best advertise himself. He ought to give Sunday dinners, and, later on, entertainments at Richmond and riverside localities. Then she would see that proper notice was given in the society papers, and that would show Miss fitzalan and her skinflint of a chaperon the importance of a moneyed man.</p>

<p>“That won’t do me much good with her,” muttered Staunton as if to himself.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that girl? Yes, to be sure it will. Why, it will show her how true, how sincere, you are! You could marry any one, and choose a nobody like her, without a penny to bless herself with!”</p>

<p>firmly convinced that, although she sometimes rubbed him the wrong way, Miss Delamere was an admirable counsellor, Staunton promised to be guided by her, and be duly called in a brougham to convey her to Mrs Hammond’s reception.</p>

<p>Trevelyan and Herbert arrived soon after.</p>

<p>“This is a capital house,” said the latter, “and the decorations in good taste. I say, Trev., what an ‘admiring circle’ has gathered round our de- mure little friend! She is as simply dressed as a Quakeress, but, by jove! she has a distinguished air in that cloudy, soft black garment. Come along, we must not be outsiders.”</p>

<p>As Herbert remarked, there was quite a little crowd round Miss fitzalan; but she was evidently composed and at ease. At this she was herself surprised. The fact of her stage success gave her self-reliance, and this is always confirmed by freedom from self-consciousness. Herbert soon contrived to take his place beside her.</p>

<p>“You are holding a court to-night!” he said, with a caressing smile. “How does your head stand your sudden elevation to what is, no doubt, your proper place?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I feel very happy and comfortable”—smiling brightly on him. “Do I not see Mr Trevelyan? Will he not come and speak to me?”</p>

<p>“There’s the reward of modesty. I was so eager to attract your notice I pushed my way to your side. He hangs back and is asked for. Dick Trevelyan is a very cool hand! Here, Trevelyan, Miss fitzalan is asking for you,” and Herbert rather ostentatiously drew back to speak to Mrs Bligh, who was sitting near talking with Mrs Hammond, to whom she immediately introduced Herbert.</p>

<p>“I hoped you would have come and told me what you thought of ‘Kitty,’” said Miss fitzalan, holding out her hand to Trevelyan, who drew a chair beside her.</p>

<p>“I wished to come and congratulate you,” he said, letting his eyes rest upon her with a sense of pleasure and complete satisfaction, “but I was prevented” (“by my own prudence,” he added to himself). “I thoroughly endorse the verdict of the public. Your ‘Kitty’ was not only delightful—she was true!”</p>

<p>“You make me very happy,” she returned, looking frankly into his eyes. “I have partly to thank you for my success. If you had not told me to trust my own instinct I should not have had the courage to differ on some points from Mrs Bligh. I longed to hear what you thought, and it is nearly a fortnight since you saw me.”</p>

<p>“I saw you last Wednesday, and I saw you last night.”</p>

<p>“Did you—did you indeed?” blushing with pleasure. “How very good of you.”</p>

<p>“Good to myself. You don’t suppose I should go and look at you if I did not like doing so?” The words were blunt, but the tone in which they were spoken made them very sweet to Cara.</p>

<p>“That is better still. I want you to like me.”</p>

<p>Trevelyan smiled a little grimly.</p>

<p>“Have you had tea, or lemonade, or anything? That is, I want to get you away from this crowd.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have had tea, but I now want lemonade, so we will go and look for it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” offering his arm.</p>

<p>“How very charming it is, the undercurrent of music they always have here on Sunday nights. It makes it so much easier to talk,” she said.</p>

<p>“Do you ever find it difficult?” asked Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” laughing good-humouredly; “yet there are people who make it difficult.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Do you find acting exhaust you?”</p>

<p>“Less than it did the first few nights; but this part is a very light one. I imagine anything tragic would be much more trying.”</p>

<p>“And you are not a giant.”</p>

<p>“No, but I am always well.”</p>

<p>“What an unusual admission! Here is a quiet corner inside the door of the conservatory. I’ll bring you some lemonade,” which he did; also another chair, and established himself beside her. “You had a crowded audience, Miss fitzalan, last night. I noticed a Royal Highness among them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Prince of——. He asked to be introduced to me—or, I suppose, desired that I should be presented to him. I was alarmed at the idea. I did not know quite how to behave, but he was just like any other gentleman. Indeed, his manners are charming. He was very complimentary—not to me only, but to all the company—and said there was such a high finish to the whole thing, it reminded him of a French play. Poor dear Mr Bellamy was so pleased! But I did not see you, Mr Trevelyan.”</p>

<p>“Did you look for me?”</p>

<p>“No; not last night. I did before, but, not having found you, I thought you would not come again. Mr Staunton is always there—always in the stalls. He throws me flowers; one fell on the footlights one evening, and every one laughed. When I think of him, it makes me quite nervous. I wish he would go away.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he is a great nuisance.”</p>

<p>Both were silent for a minute. Then Cara resumed as if to herself: “I have read your book. I liked some of it very, very much; but some seemed rather dry.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt it did. Are you fond of reading?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very fond. I hardly ever find a book that I cannot interest myself in. Are you going to write another?”</p>

<p>“Yes, later on. I am going to dare a bold venture—I am going to write a novel!”</p>

<p>“Ah! It must indeed be a great undertaking. You have to invent your subject as well as to treat it.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Have you sisters?” </p>
<p>“No. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because it must be a help in describing women to have lived with sisters.”</p>

<p>“One can gather a general idea of your sex even without that open sesame,” returned Trevelyan demurely.</p>

<p>They talked on easily and pleasantly about books, each absorbed in the other, when a deep, rough voice aroused them.”</p>

<p>I am to say that Mrs Bligh wishes Miss fitzalan to come home.”</p>

<p>Both started and looked up to see Staunton “glowering ” at them. Instinctively, unconsciously, Cara laid her hand on Trevelyan’s arm. He rose quickly, hoping to mask the movement.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Staunton. Pray tell Mrs Bligh we are coming.” </p>

<p>Staunton turned without a word, and went away, a gleam of fierce anger in his deep, dark eyes.”</p>

<p>You are not really afraid of him?” asked Trevelyan, turning his head to look into her pale, pathetic face, while he drew her arm through his.</p>

<p>“I am! it is perhaps foolish. But, Mr Trevelyan, help me to avoid him!”</p>

<p>“I will do all that is possible to serve you,” he whispered, pressing the hand which lay on his arm.</p>
