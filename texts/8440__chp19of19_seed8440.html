<title>Chapter 19 of TWO MEN O’ MENDIP by WALTER RAYMOND</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- CHAPTER 19.<br>THE END -->
<p>April again. Over towards Ubley the cuckoo was calling, and swallows, with here and there a “devil-scritch,” darted to and fro along the road. The primroses were out most beautiful in the valley, and cowslips in the lew between Black rocks; some of them so big as oxslips too. Buds were swelling — the lilac bushes thick in leaf. Again the sunlight shone across the stacks, and glistened upon the ivy too. The grass was fresh and green, for Mother Earth enrobed herself anew, caring no more for what was past and gone than the merry thrushes for their last year’s brood.</p>
<p>Sophia Pierce was waiting by the porch alone, just where last spring she watched with little Patty Winterhead. The length and breadth of Mendip was as bare as then. Neither man nor woman came in sight upon the hills. They were all gone as before, far away across the moors.</p>
<p>Sophia walked restlessly up the path and stood by the gate. There had been so much talk, and now all was over.</p>
<p>After John Winterhead gave himself up and was taken to gaol, she stayed at Charterhouse as caretaker. Solomon looked over day by day, and they put in the crops most wonderful well. Solomon was a tidy farmer, mind, for all his simple ways, and John Winterhead could have done no better himself. So everybody agreed, and the neighbours were all glad. They looked to see John Winterhead back after a while; for, as Solomon argued, and, sure then, his law ought to be good, he being a constable:—</p>
<p>“If ‘twere a fight there’s no murder; an’ if ‘twerden a fight, ‘twere a sudden occasion; so that if John Winterhead struck a blow that chanced to kill, be it in anger but wi’out intent, look-y-zee, why then ‘tis manslaughter, an’ not o’ the wo’st neither”. And all the fireside gossip was of one tale; that never a jury in Somerset, knowing the rights o’ it, and one or two maybe acquainted with the man, would convict.</p>
<p>Jims Matravis and one o’ Blagdon had come to words the day before yesterday, as they jogged along together down to Wells to hear the trial. Jims was most terrible afeard that John Winterhead would get two years. But one o’ Blagdon said: “Never in this world — not wi’ a good counsellor to plead for un. Not a day more ‘an six months.” And so they contradicted and wrangled all along the road.</p>
<p>But neither subtleties nor good-will were to be of any account.</p>
<p>John Winterhead had kept counsel so well, that not even his own lawyer knew what was in his mind.</p>
<p>The neighbours saw him standing in the dock, and called upon to plead. The court was still. Every eye was bent upon him, for his story was in every mouth; folk were craning forward to hear him speak.</p>
<p>“Guilty,” he answered, in a voice low but clear.</p>
<p>A rustle of surprise passed over the rows of people who heard.</p>
<p>Then followed remonstrance and whispered explanation, as if he could not know what he was doing. But John Winterhead stood firm. He only knew what was in his thoughts, he said, and he had no mind to hide or keep anything back. If he had always given the law its own, all would have been well. If he had never seen fear to speak out and act the honesty in his heart, there was never a thing on earth could have come nigh to hurt him. He would rather die than lie and live with the thought of what was past.</p>
<p>So there was nothing for it but to pass sentence. That was but one clear day ago, for in those days the law was swift; and now Sophia was watching once again to see the people back from Hang Fair.</p>
<p>They were so slow in coming that she could be still no longer. She took the path which Patty had trod so often, and went down the drove to the head of Cheddar Gorge and waited. The place was quite solitary. Not a sound broke in upon her ear. The tall cliffs towered cold and grey on either side, and she glanced up at the narrow ledge and shuddered. If she had never set John Winterhead to watch, Patty would have been at Ubley now, and she mayhap mistress of Charterhouse. Yet how was she to know? It was not her fault. But whilst she reasoned thus she could not reassure herself; and slowly over the lonely hills the dusk crept on.</p>
<p>From down the gap came the sound of horses’ hoofs. So they were coming. Yes. That was the “clackety-clack” of Solomon’s cob, sure enough. She leaned forward, looking for them to loom out of the darkness into sight.</p>
<p>They rode on in silence. Yet when they saw her by the gate beside the bit of copse, one o’ Blagdon whispered to Solomon, and they drew rein.</p>
<p>It was all over — ay, all over, they said. Then they told John Winterhead’s last words — that he was willing to die as ever he had been to pay a debt in all his life — and Solomon cried like a child. He should never take delight in being constable or anything again, he sobbed. And so they went slowly on together, until they presently stood once more before the old ivy-covered house, and there, too sad for company, they parted, some one way, some another, to their homes.</p>
<p>Yet Solomon, strange as it may seem, a short while afterwards married Aunt Maria, and lived happy to a fine old age, as a good heart should.</p>
<p>And Sophia got her chance like the rest, for she wed wi’ the one o’ Blagdon that gave Patty the pretty little pig.</p>
<p>Charterhouse was sold. But the new owner did not love and care for it as John Winterhead had done; and long ago the walls crumbled into decay, so that now not even the foundations can be traced.</p>
<p>Cousin Selina became well-off; and Cousin Selina’s Emily Jane was the wife of young Tom Duckett o’ Priddy, whose name mayhap you have heard.</p>
<p>And still the ancient, weather-beaten rocks look down, cold and unchangeable, as if human love and passion, sorrow and tears, are all too brief to be of moment in the vast immensity of time.</p>
