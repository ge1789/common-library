<title>Chapter 16 of Oliphant’s Miss Majoribanks</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>That evening was one which all the people in Grange Lane had unanimously
concluded would be rather hard upon Miss Marjoribanks. To be sure, when
a crisis arrives there is always a certain excitement which keeps one
up; but afterwards, when the excitement is over, then is the time when
it becomes really trying. There was naturally, under these
circumstances, a larger assemblage than usual to watch the progress of
the little drama, and how Lucilla would behave; for, after all, society
would be excessively tame if it were not for these personal
complications, which are always arising, and which are so much better
than a play. As for the Doctor himself, the portion of the evening’s
entertainment which particularly amused him was that which preceded all
the rest—the reception given by Lucilla to her guests at dinner, and
especially to the culprit, who came in quite alone, and found nobody to
stand up for him. Mr Cavendish, who felt to the full the difficulty of
his position, and, to tell the truth, was a little ashamed of himself,
came late, in order to abridge his trial as much as possible; but
Lucilla’s habitual good-fortune was not confined only to her own
necessities, but seemed to involve everybody opposed to her in a
ceaseless ill-luck, which was very edifying to the spectators. Mr
Cavendish was so late that the other guests had formed into groups round
the room, leaving a great open space and avenue of approach to the lady
of the house in the middle; and the audience, thus arranged, was very
impatient and unfavourable to the lingerer who kept them waiting for
their dinner. When he came in at last, instead of doing anything to help
him, everybody ceased talking and looked on in stern silence as the
wretched culprit walked all the length of the room up to Lucilla through
the unoccupied space which exposed him so unmercifully on every side.
They all stopped in the middle of what they were saying, and fixed stony
eyes on him, as the dead sailors did on the Ancient Mariner. He had a
very good spirit, but still there are circumstances which take the
courage out of a man. To be sure, Miss Marjoribanks, when he reached her
at last, received Mr Cavendish with the utmost grace and cordiality, but
it is easy to imagine what must have been the feelings of the
unfortunate hero. The Balaclava charge itself, in the face of all the
guns, could have been nothing to the sensation of walking through that
horrible naked space, through a crowd of reproachful men who were
waiting for dinner; and it was only after it was all over, and Mr
Cavendish had safely arrived at Miss Marjoribanks’s side, and was being
set at his ease, poor wretch, by her incomparable sweetness, that the
Doctor, with a certain grim smile on his countenance, came and shook
hands with his unfortunate guest.</p>

<p>“You are late,” Dr Marjoribanks said, taking out the great watch by
which all the pulses of Grange Lane considered it their duty to keep
time, and which marked five minutes after seven, as everybody could see.
It was ten minutes after seven by the pretty French clock on the
mantelpiece, and at least twenty by the lowering countenances of Dr
Marjoribanks’s guests. Mr Cavendish made the best of his unhappy
position, and threw himself upon Lucilla’s charity, who was the only one
who had any compassion upon him; for to see Mrs Chiley’s forbidding
countenance no one could have believed that she had ever called him “my
dear.” “Dinner is on the table, papa,” Miss Marjoribanks said, with a
little reassuring nod to the culprit who had made her his refuge; and
she got up and shook out her white draperies with a charitable commotion
for which her faithless admirer blessed her in his heart.</p>

<p>But the place at her left hand was not left vacant for Mr Cavendish; he
had not the spirit to claim it, even had he had the time; and the
consequence was that he found himself next to his brother-in-law at
table, which was indeed a hard fate. As for Lucilla, she was quite
radiant when the famous dish made its appearance which Nancy had
elaborated to please her, and told the story of its introduction to her
two next neighbours, in a half whisper, to their immense amusement.
“When the servants are gone I will tell you what we are laughing at,”
she breathed across the table to Mrs Chiley, who was “more than
delighted,” as she said, to see her dear Lucilla keeping up so well; and
when the dessert was put upon the table, and Thomas had finally
disappeared, Miss Marjoribanks kept her promise. “I could not think how
I was going to get her to consent,” Lucilla said, “but you know she
thought I was in low spirits, the dear old soul, and that it would be a
comfort to me.” Though there was often a great deal of fun at Dr
Marjoribanks’s table, nothing was ever heard there to compare with the
laughter that greeted Lucilla’s narrative. Everybody was so entirely
aware of the supposed cause of the low spirits, and indeed was so
conscious of having speculated, like Nancy, upon Miss Marjoribanks’s
probable demeanour at this trying moment, that the laughter was not mere
laughter, but conveyed, at the same time a confession of guilt and a
storm of applause and admiration. As for Mr Cavendish, it was alarming
to look at him in the terrible paroxysm of confusion and shame which he
tried to shield under the universal amusement. Miss Marjoribanks left
the dining-room that evening with the soothing conviction that she had
administered punishment of the most annihilating kind, without for a
moment diverging from the perfect sweetness and amiability with which it
was her duty to treat all her father’s guests. It was so complete and
perfect that there was not another word to be said either on one side or
the other; and yet Lucilla had not in the least committed herself, or
condescended from her maiden dignity. As for Dr Marjoribanks, if he had
chuckled over it before, in anticipation, it may be supposed how he
enjoyed now this perfect vindication of his daughter’s capacity for
taking care of herself. The sound of the victory was even heard
upstairs, where the young ladies at the open windows were asking each
other, with a little envy, what the men could be laughing at. There was,
as we have said, a larger assembly than usual that night. For one thing,
it was moonlight, and all the people from the country were there; and
then public curiosity was profoundly concerned as to how Lucilla was to
conduct herself on so trying an occasion. The laughter even jarred on
the sensitive feelings of some people who thought, where a young girl’s
happiness was concerned, that it was too serious a matter to be laughed
at; but then Miss Marjoribanks was not a person who could be classed
with ordinary young girls, in the general acceptation of the word.</p>

<p>It was when things were at this crisis, and all eyes were directed to
Lucilla, and a certain expectation was diffused through the company,
that Miss Marjoribanks made that proposal of adjourning to the garden,
which was received with so much applause. Lucilla’s instinct, or rather
her genius, had warned her that something out of the ordinary course of
proceedings would be expected from her on that special occasion. She
could not get up and make a speech to her excited and curious audience,
neither could she, apropos of nothing, tell over again the story which
had been received with such applause downstairs; and yet something was
wanting. The ordinary routine did not satisfy Lucilla’s constituency,
who had come with the laudable intention of observing her on a trying
occasion, and watching how she got through it. “The air is so delicious
to-night that I had some seats placed in the garden,” Miss Marjoribanks
said, “and if you all like we will sing to you up here, and give you as
much music as ever you please. You know I never would consent to be too
musical when everybody was in one room. It does not matter so much, when
there are a suite; but then papa, you know, is only a professional man,
and I have but one drawing-room,” said Lucilla, with sweet humility. It
was Lady Richmond to whom she was addressing herself at the moment, who
was a lady who liked to be the great lady of the party. “It is only in
summer that we can be a little like you fine people, who have as many
rooms as you please. When you are at a little distance we will sing to
you all the evening, if you like.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, are you sure you feel able for so much exertion?” said
Lady Richmond, who was one of those people who did not think a young
girl’s happiness a thing to be trifled with; and she looked with what
she described afterwards as a very searching expression in Miss
Marjoribanks’s face.</p>

<p>“Dear Lady Richmond, I hope I am always able for my duty,” said that
gentle martyr. “Papa would be wretched if he did not think we were all
enjoying ourselves; and you know it is the object of my life to be a
comfort to papa.”</p>

<p>This was what the searching expression in Lady Richmond’s eyes elicited
from Lucilla. The sentiment was perhaps a little different from that
which she had conveyed to her delighted auditors in the dining-room, but
at the same time it was equally true; for everybody in Carlingford was
aware of the grand object of Miss Marjoribanks’s existence. Lady
Richmond went down to the garden at the head of a bevy of ladies, and
seated herself under the drawing-room windows, and placed a chair beside
her own for Mrs Chiley. “I am afraid that dear girl is keeping up too
well,” Lady Richmond said; “I never saw such fortitude. All the young
people say she does not feel it; but as soon as I fixed my eyes on her I
saw the difference. You can always find out what a girl’s feelings are
when you look into her eyes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs Chiley, with a little doubt, for she had been shaken in
her convictions by the universal laughter, though she was a little
mystified herself by Lucilla’s anecdote; and then she had never been
gifted with eyes like Lady Richmond’s, which looked people through and
through. “She goes through a great deal, and it never seems to do her
any harm,” the old lady said, with a little hesitation. “It is such a
comfort that she has a good constitution, especially as her mother was
so delicate; and then Lucilla has such a spirit——”</p>

<p>“But one may try a good constitution too far,” said Lady Richmond; “and
I am certain she is full of feeling. It is sure to come out when she
sings, and that is why I came to this seat. I should not like to lose a
note. And do tell me who is that horrid flirting, disagreeable girl,”
added the county lady, drawing her chair a little closer. By this time
the garden was full of pretty figures and pleasant voices, and under the
lime-tree there was a glimmer of yellow light from the lamps, and on the
other side the moon was coming up steady like a ball of silver over the
dark outlines of Carlingford; and even the two voices which swelled
forth upstairs in the fullest accord, betraying nothing of the personal
sentiments of their owners, were not more agreeable to hear than the
rustle and murmur of sound which rose all over Dr Marjoribanks’s smooth
lawn and pretty shrubbery. Here and there a group of the older people
sat, like Lady Richmond and Mrs Chiley, listening with all their might;
and all about them were clusters of girls and their natural attendants,
arrested in their progress, and standing still breathless, “just for
this bar,” as young people pause in their walks and talks to listen to a
chance nightingale. And, to be sure, whenever anybody was tired of the
music, there were quantities of corners to retire into, not to speak of
that bright spot full of yellow light under the lime-tree.</p>

<p>“Nobody but Lucilla ever could have thought of anything so delicious,”
was what everybody said. And then the two singers upstairs gave so much
scope to curiosity. “Do you think they are all by themselves?” Lydia
Brown was heard to ask, with a little natural anxiety; and the livelier
imaginations among the party set to work at once to invent impossible
tortures which the soprano might inflict on the contralto. But, to tell
the truth, the two singers were by no means alone. Half the gentlemen of
the dinner-party, who were past the sentimental age, and did not care
about moonlight, had gone upstairs according to their use and wont, and
remained there, finding, to their great satisfaction, room to move
about, and comfortable chairs to sit down in. They sat and chatted in
the corners in great content and good-humour, while Lucilla and Barbara
executed the most charming duets. Now and then old Colonel Chiley paused
to put his two hands softly together and cry “Brava!” but on the whole
the gentlemen were not much disturbed by the music. And then there were
a few ladies, who were subject to neuralgia, or apt to take bad colds in
the head, who preferred being upstairs. So that if Lucilla had meant to
pinch or maltreat her rival, circumstances would have made it
impossible. Miss Marjoribanks did nothing to Barbara, except incite her
to sing her very best; but no doubt she was the means of inflicting
considerable pain on Mr Cavendish, who stood at a little distance, and
looked and listened to both, and perhaps had inward doubts as to the
wisdom of his choice. Such was the arrangement of the personages of the
social drama, and it was in this way that everybody was occupied, when
an event occurred which at a later period awoke much excitement in
Carlingford, and had no small influence upon the future fate of some of
the individuals whose history is here recorded.</p>

<p>Everything was as calm and cheerful and agreeable as if Carlingford had
been a social paradise, and Miss Marjoribanks’s drawing-room the seventh
heaven of terrestrial harmony. The sky itself was not more peaceful, nor
gave less indication of any tempest than did the tranquil atmosphere
below, where all the people knew each other, and everybody was friendly.
Lucilla had just risen from the piano, and there was a little pause, in
which cheers were audible from the garden, and Colonel Chiley, in the
midst of his conversation, patted his two hands together; and it was
just at that moment that the drawing-room door opened, and Thomas came
in, followed by a gentleman. The gentleman was a stranger, whom Miss
Marjoribanks had never seen before, and she made a step forward, as was
her duty as mistress of the house. But when she had made that one step,
Lucilla suddenly stood still, arrested by something more urgent than the
arrival of a stranger. Mr Cavendish, too, had been standing with his
face to the door, and had seen the new arrival. He was directly in front
of Lucilla, so near her that he could not move without attracting her
attention. When Miss Marjoribanks took that step in advance, Mr
Cavendish, as if by the same impulse, suddenly, and without saying a
word, turned right round like a man who had seen something terrible, at
which he dared not take a second look. He was too much absorbed at that
moment in his own feelings to know that he was betraying himself to
Lucilla, or even to be conscious that she was near him. His face was
more than pale; it had a green ghastly look, as of a face from which all
the blood had suddenly been withdrawn to reinforce the vital centre in
some failing of nature. His under-lip hung down, and two hollows which
had never been seen there before appeared in his cheeks. Miss
Marjoribanks was so taken by surprise that she stood still, thinking no
more of her duties, but regarding in utter dismay and amazement the look
of dead stupefied terror which thus appeared so unexpectedly before her.
Mr Cavendish had turned right round, turning his back upon a lady to
whom he had been talking the minute before. But he was as unconscious of
doing so as of the fact that he had presented the spectacle of his
miserable surprise and alarm in the most striking way to the one woman
present who had a right to entertain a certain grudge against him.</p>

<p>During this moment of unusual inaction on Lucilla’s part, the stranger
had been led up to Colonel Chiley, and had shaken hands with him, and
was entering into some explanations which Miss Marjoribanks divined with
her usual quick intelligence; and then the old Colonel roused himself up
from his easy-chair, and leaned over to speak to Dr Marjoribanks, and
showed symptoms of approaching the lady of the house. All these
movements Lucilla followed breathlessly, with a strange consciousness
that only her presence of mind stood between her faithless suitor and a
real danger. And as if to prove the difference, Barbara Lake chose that
moment of all others to show her power, and made an appeal to Mr
Cavendish and his taste in music, to which the unhappy man made no
response. Miss Marjoribanks saw there was no time to lose. With a
fearless hand she threw down a great portfolio of music which happened
to be close to her, just at his feet, making a merciful disturbance. And
then she turned and made her curtsey, and received the homage of Mr
Archdeacon Beverley, who had arrived a day before he was expected, and
had come to look after his host, since his host had not been at home to
receive him.</p>

<p>“But you have broken your music-stand or something, Lucilla,” said the
Colonel.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it is only a portfolio. I can’t think what could make me so
awkward,” said Miss Marjoribanks; “I suppose it was seeing some one come
in whom I didn’t know.” And then the old gentleman, as was his duty,
paid the Archdeacon a compliment on having made such a commotion. “We
used to have the best of it in our day,” said the old soldier; “but now
you churchmen are the men.” Miss Marjoribanks heard the door open again
before this little speech was finished. It was Mr Cavendish, who was
going out with a long step, as if he with difficulty kept himself from
running; and he never came back again to say good-night, or made any
further appearance either out of doors or indoors. It is true that the
Archdeacon made himself very agreeable, but then one man never quite
makes up for another. Miss Marjoribanks said nothing about it, not even
when Mrs Woodburn came up to her with a scared face, and in full
possession of her own identity, which of itself was an extraordinary
fact, and proved that something had happened; but it would be vain to
say that Lucilla was not much excited by this sudden gleam of mystery.
It gave the Archdeacon an extraordinary and altogether unexpected
attraction; and as for Mr Cavendish, it was utterly inconceivable that a
man in society, whom everybody knew about, should give way to such a
panic. The question was, What did it mean?</p>
