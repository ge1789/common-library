“By Jove, it becomes quite exciting.”
</p>
</div>
<p>
We left Mr. Dutton in the Brompton Road, as he got out of his hansom, and we heard of him incidentally
afterwards as going off with his portmanteau in another cab to catch a train the following morning, he
having received a letter by the early post from his uncle in the country, asking him to come down to
spend a few days, an invitation which the young man never failed to obey, whatever other engagements he
might have; the fact being that this same uncle was a brother of his mother’s, whom the young man had
lost many years before, and as his father had since lived almost entirely abroad, the house of his uncle
had been his home during his holidays from school, and thus he had learned to love the old man for his
own sake, more especial]y as he was very rich, and Mr. Dutton hoped naturally that some portion of the
money, if not the large estate on which he resided, might some day become his own.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Grey, for such was his name, was a very spare old gentleman, who “enjoyed bad health,” and though
there was really very little the matter with him, he would often get a fit of the blues, when he would
send off to his nephew to come and pay him a visit, usually declaring that if Charles wished to see him
alive he must start at once by first train. Mr. Dutton had, of course, become so accustomed to this style
of summons that though be never failed to go as quickly as possihle, he was quite prepared on his arrival
at Pembroke Lodge to find his uncle standing at the hall door to welcome him, and in as good a state of
health as an old batchelor of seventy could ever hope to enjoy. Such, indeed, was the case on the present
occasion, and though Mr. Grey thought it necessary to entertain his nephew with a long list of his
ailments, among which suppressed gout was one of the principal, Charles knew, by past experience, that
the maladies were purely imaginary, and was not the least surprised, when dinner was announced that
evening, to see his uncle eat most heartily, and seem, as indeed he was, as happy and contented with
himself, and the world at large, as it was possible he could be.
</p>
<p>
Two days passed, and it was on the third morning, when the uncle and nephew met at breakfast, that the
latter could not avoid noticing how preoccupied Mr. Grey seemed to be; he ate very little, and hardly
opened his lips during the meal, and when it was over, went at once to the library, which he used as his
own writing room, and whither he very soon summoned Mr. Dutton.
</p>
<p>
When his nephew entered, the old gentleman was standing with his back to the fire, his coat tails being
held apart by his two hands, one on each side. As Mr. Dutton came forward his uncle nodded with his head
towards an easy chair to his right hand, which half unconsciously the young man took, when Mr. Grey said—
</p>
<p>
“Charles, I have looked on you almost, if not quite, as my own son, and I had hoped you regarded me as
your second father, and would have treated me with the same confidence, and come to me at once for advice
or assistance in any trouble or difficulty, but I am sorry to find I have made a mistake, and the awakening
has been very bitter to me.”
</p>
<p>
He paused, and his nephew answered, without a moment’s hesitation—
</p>
<p>
“I must ask you to explain yourself further, sir, for I confess I am quite at a loss to understand the
cause of the bitter awakening to which you allude.”
</p>
<p>
“The fact, which has been conveyed to me through the post this morning, that you have been much pressed
for money to pay your bills, and have not had confidence enough in your old uncle to come to him openly
and straightforwardly to ask for assistance.”
</p>
<p>
Charles paused for a moment to consider what his uncle could mean, but, before he could reply, Mr. Grey
stepped to the table, and took up two letters, both of which he handed to the young man; the uppermost
of which having come by the post Mr. Dutton opened first, and read as follows:—
</p>
<div>
<!-- Address is right justified to resemble a letter, Sir is unindented, "We remain", "your obedient" and "Drake and Mount" are all increasingly indented -->
<p>
“Oxford Street,<br>
“London.<br>

“Sir,<br>
“Having applied several times to your nephew, Mr. Dutton, of Duke Street, for payment of our account,
amounting to £134 l0s., and as he persistently refuses to settle the same, we have taken the liberty
of writing to you on the subject. Averse, as we are, under all circumstances, to take legal proceedings,
still we cannot consent to lose so large a sum, and feel sure you will agree with us in thinking we
have waited long enough for payment. Leaving ourselves unreservedly in your hands,<br>
“We remain, Sir,<br>
“Your obedient Servants,<br>
“Drake and Mount.”
</p>
</div>
<p>
Mr. Dutton laid down the letter, and opened the second one, which ran as follows:—
</p>
<div>
<!-- Messrs. is center justified, the rest of the letter is formatted the same as the previous, Drake and Mount is still in small caps -->
<p>
“Messrs. Drake and Mount,<br>
“Dear Sirs,<br>
“I beg to enclose a cheque in payment of your account. My nephew, doubtless, has overlooked it, as
young men are often careless in money matters. An acknowledgment by return of post will oblige.<br>
“Yours truly,<br>
“C. Grey.”
</p>
</div>
<p>
Charles rose from his chair, and holding his uncle’s letter and cheque in his left hand, walked up
to the old gentleman and held out his right, which, his uncle taking, they stood hand in hand looking
in each other’s faces. A pleased and most happy smile lit up the countenance of the young man, while
that of Mr. Grey wore a puzzled expression, which was increased tenfold when he saw his nephew
deliberately throw the letter and cheque which he held in his left hand into the fire, saying as he did so—
</p>
<p>
“Words fail me to express the pleasure which your most kind and considerate goodness has caused me; it
is, indeed, a true happiness to me to feel I have one friend to whom I can always apply in any difficulty
in which I may find myself. I have burnt your cheque now because the whole thing is a swindle; I do
not owe the money for which they are dunning me; I never entered their shop twice in my life, and I
am therefore anxious that they should put the matter into their lawyer’s hands. I want the whole matter
sifted, and it is by far the easiest mode to do this, to let them sue me, prove the delivery of the
articles to me, when, as they say, I had chambers in the Albany, which, you know, I never had; but
the truth is, they are not sure of their case. I suppose there is no doubt they did deliver the articles
to some person or other, and though the stupid messenger swears that it was to me, and two or three
of their clerks do the same, it so happens, as you will see, if you look at the bill and dates, that
I was abroad at the time three-fourths of the things were purchased, and so I told their bill
collector, which makes the firm still more cautious how they take the case into court, and now they
have made a last bid for the money in writing to you. How lucky it is that I was here, for I feel
sure you would have paid them, and then it would have forced us to go into court to get the money back.”
</p>
<p>
“What a curious business!” said Mr. Grey. “And you do not know the name of the person to whom the
things were sent?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I did not inquire; I was too angry with the bill collector to ask, even if he would have told
me, which I dare say he would not; but I wish you would look over these letters, and you will see
that the whole affair is not only curious, but mysterious. I put them in my pocket on purpose to
show them to you, and ask your advice.”
</p>
<p>
A comical and most amused expression came over the old gentleman’s face as he read one of the letters
handed to him, and, as he refolded it, he said—
</p>
<p>
“I wonder who the ‘Henry’ is, that Lucy believes she is writing to; it is odd that she blames you
for changing your name without telling her, and wants to know if it was done to get rid of her, but
she gives no sort of clue as to what your name was previous to the change.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Dutton, smiling, “she naturally supposes I know that, and so there is no occasion
for her to tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“But unfortunately, you see, you don’t,” answered Mr. Grey, who had now opened the second letter,
in which he read as follows:—
</p>
<p>
“Henry, no one can blame you for changing your name, considering the character of the man with whom
you have to deal; it is perhaps a pity you have not altered also in some way (such as a false moustache)
your personal appearance; however you know best. Your kind heart and good nature must ever be the
same, and it is to them I appeal when I ask you to save her—you will easily guess who—I dare not
mention names. She has arranged to leave London by the ten o’clock express for the North on the
morning of the 10th of February from Euston Station; she hopes to get out of his clutches, but she
is mistaken; by some means he knows all, and has arranged to have her arrested at Rugby. Go with her,
try to get into the same carriage with her, and warn her; if you cannot do that, insist on seeing the
warrant of the man who will take her, it will probably be a good imitation, but all the same will
be a forgery. Do not hesitate to accuse the man, and give him in charge, while you telegraph to the
magistrate who is supposed to have signed it. Act boldly, and fear not, I will be at hand to help if
necessary. “A Friend.”
<!-- "A FRIEND" is in small caps and is right justified on the same line as "if necessary" -->
</p>
<p>
“What did you do?” said Mr. Grey, as he finished the letter, which was written in a clear, legible
hand, such as a clerk in a merchant’s office would probably employ.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said his nephew, “you know my unfortunate habit of letting letters accumulate without being
opened sometimes for days and even weeks, unless I know who is the writer. This one was left at my
house about two days previously, and put by my servant on my table with half-a-dozen others, and
there found by me when I came home late after a dance. I remember looking them over, and saying to
myself ‘they will keep,’ went to bed, and thought no more about them. As it happened the next evening
I went to the play, and as I was coming out with our party some one in the crush said behind me, ‘You
got my letter and will not forget. Do not look round, we are watched.’ As soon as I could get away
I went home, full of curiosity as to what letter could be referred to. I soon found this one, and
at once made up my mind I would go, if only for the fun of exposing the bla kg-d detective. It was too
<!-- it does say "bla kg-d" all lowercase. Not sure if this is a typo or just a strange title from elsewhere in the book -->
late, however, to tell my servant to call me, and have breakfast ready, and as bad luck would have it
I never woke till a quarter to nine. I dressed as quickly as I could, swallowed a hasty breakfast,
and went off in a hansom just in time to be too late to catch the train, and got a nasty fall for my
pains in running to the platform.”
</p>
<p>
“And you know nothing,” said Mr. Grey, “of the poor woman, whether she was caught, and, if so, what
became of her.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing whatever,” answered his nephew, “the information I had received was so slight, and not even
a name mentioned, that I could make no inquiries. But you have not read the third letter.”
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” said the old gentleman, who now perused its contents, which were as follows:—
</p>
<div>
<!-- slightly more whitespace between this paragraph and the rest of the text -->
<p>
“He has seen you, recognized you at once, and had you followed. He has gone abroad for a few days;
use the opportunity of his absence to move your quarters further West, and wear a moustache, or
otherwise disguise yourself. Be warned in time, and avoid him as you would poison.”
</p>
</div>
<p>
“Even more mysterious than the others,” said Mr. Grey; “not even a signature. When did you receive it?”
</p>
<p>
“I found it on my table when I came home, after missing the train,” said Mr. Dutton. “What do you
advise me to do? Shall I change my quarters, or take no notice of the letter?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly should not move at present,” said his uncle; ” I should stay where you are, if only to
try and discover something more of whom the ‘He’ is, that you are warned against; and besides he can
do you no harm that I see. By Jove, it becomes quite exciting. Be sure you let me know if you hear
any more; if I was a younger man I’d come to town myself, and take a lodging close by—I would indeed.”
</p>
<p>
So the conversation ended; Mr. Dutton going back to London the following day, after promising to keep
his uncle <em>au courant</em> of all that took place with regard to the mystery, as they called it; and,
taking with him an envelope, slipped into his hand at the last moment, and in which he found a cheque
for £200, which the old gentleman wrote would be much better applied in elucidating the mystery, than
in paying some one else’s account to Messrs. Drake and Mount.
