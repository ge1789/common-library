<!-- Volume 1 Chapter 3 -->
<p>It was a week later. Fred and I were <em>tête-à-tête</em> in a large empty upper chamber, which still went by the name of the "playroom." A rickety old sofa, a couple of chairs at one end of the room,
boxes full of the broken toys of our childhood piled up at the other, and a dilapidated rocking-
horse in the centre, made up the furniture of this cheerful apartment, where on wet days Fred retired to smoke, and I followed him to converse.</p>
<p>It was a wet day to-day--a soft, steady, noiseless summer rain poured ceaselessly down upon the parched earth without, and a warm, steamy vapour came up again out of its grateful bosom. We could hear the rain gurgling in the leaden pipes under the eaves of our gabled house, and dripping in great heavy drops off the red tiles of the roof outside the windows of our playroom.</p>
<p>"It's a fine thing for the crops," had said Farmer Thompson, when he drove up in his tax-cart that morning.</p>
<p>But Fred and I did not care about the crops. Who does, before they are twenty? All we thought of was that it kept us indoors the whole of one long summer day, and that we had no other refuge than the old attic-room to spend it in.</p>
<p>Fred lay full length on his back on the sofa, with a pipe in his mouth. Hard by sat, or rather squatted, my fair self, knees and nose together, on the ancient rocking-horse, which swayed gently backwards and forwards under my weight, with a musical creaking.</p>
<p>"I wish you would get off that thing and sit quiet," says Fred irritably, without even taking his pipe out of his mouth to address me. "I declare you make me quite sea-sick."</p>
<p>"I am so comfortable, Fred; and there's nothing else to sit on."<p>
<p>"Keep the beast still, then."</p>
<p>I obey by sliding half off Toby's back, and by putting one foot down on his green stand to steady myself, and then, stooping down over his back, I proceed to extract from its socket the stump of his well-worn tail, out of which we had long ago plucked every vestige of horse-hair, and entertained myself with vain endeavours to replace it wrong end foremost.</p>
<p>No sound save the puffing of Fred's pipe, the steady drip of the rain outside, and below us the faint hum of voices proceeding from papa's study, where he and our guest are closeted together.</p>
<p>For he is still at Follerton.</p>
<p>"How much longer is he going to stay?" asks Fred sulkily, indicating the lower regions of the house with a downward poke of his thumb.</p>
<p>"He must go soon, for he will be starved out. There's literally nothing left in the larder or the store cupboard, and we've eaten up all the ducks; and I have spent the whole of next week's house money which papa advanced to me."</p>
<p>"I wonder he likes to stop sponging on people who don't want him," retorted Fred. "The sooner he goes the better I shall be pleased."</p>
<p>I was silent. If there was one thing above all others that admitted of no sort of doubt, it was the dislike which Fred and Mr Hardcastle mutually entertained for each other.</p>
<p>"What on earth are they perpetually jawing about?" continued my brother. "Have you the least idea, Maggie?"</p>
<p>"No more than you have. Papa will tell me nothing, except that Mr Hardcastle is working out some plan or other for our benefit, he says."</p>
<p>"Benefit, indeed!" repeated Fred scornfully. "You may depend upon it he has about as much thought for our benefit as a boa-constrictor has for the rabbits he is about to swallow."</p>
<p>"I don't think he is altogether such a bad man, Fred," I say meditatively, being apparently wholly absorbed in scratching my own initials with a hairpin upon Toby's dappled back.</p>
<p>"Oh! as to you—you are quite converted to him! I suppose he flatters you up, and tells you you are lovely; that's all that is wanted with you girls. If you are told you are pretty, you are ready to swear that black is white, and that two and two don't make four."</p>
<p>"What rubbish, Fred!" I answered, with a little flush. "Why should an old man like that tell me I am pretty? Besides, it wouldn't be a bit true, because I am not."</p>
<p>Fred turns round and contemplates me silently for a minute in silence.</p>
<p>"No," he says, at length, with that charming candour which is the distinctive feature of fraternal intercourse, "no, I can't honestly say you are in the least pretty; though I don't think you would be quite so bad looking if your nose didn't turn the wrong way."</p>
<p>"Oh, Fred," I say, with a rueful sigh--for it is always sad to a woman to realise that she is not fair, and I believed in my brother's candid criticism from the very bottom of my heart--"I know you have all the looks, dear."</p>
<p>"Well, yes; but never mind, Madge, you have all the goodness," answers Fred consolingly.</p>
<p>An assertion which, I suppose, ought to have more than comforted me. Only somehow it hardly did so.</p>
<p>"Maggie!" calls a clear, young voice outside; "Maggie, where are you?" and at the same time a cluster of fat little green baby rosebuds came flying through the open casement and fell at our feet.</p>
<p>"It is Helen!" cried Fred; and we both hurried to the window.</p>
<p>Below, on the gravel walk stood a small figure, in a long waterproof cloak and a felt hat, almost hidden under a dripping umbrella.</p>

<p>"Come up—come up!" we cried, and Helen Marsden came upstairs into our attic.</p>
<p>"You have walked, Helen? All the way in this rain?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I walked. I had something to say, and I couldn't send a message, and there did not seem a chance of my getting a carriage out so I came off without saying a word to anybody. Mamma would only have made a fuss. I am not a bit wet, thank you, Fred,—only my boots."</p>
<p>She was divesting herself of her wraps as she talked,—a pretty, bright little creature, with yellow hair and forget-me-not blue eyes, and the complexion of a blush rose. Fred was taking her wet cloak from her.</p>
<p>"Your boots are as wet as possible!" he exclaimed. "Take them off, and I will give them to Mrs Butt to dry, and fetch you Maggie's slippers."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Fred; that will be very kind."</p>
<p>I laughed to myself to see my brother figuring as a lady's man. I wondered how wet my boots might have been before it would occur to Fred to notice the fact! I am quite certain that my feet might be drowned before it would enter into his head to fetch my slippers.</p>
<p>The instant my brother had flown off with the wet boots in his hand, Helen Marsden came close up to me, with a sudden flush upon her pretty face.</p>
<p>"I have had a letter this morning, Maggie," and she pulled one out of her pocket; "it is from my cousin Frank."</p>
<p>She looked so radiant, and withal so full of confusion, as she spoke, that the meaning of it all seemed to me to be plainly written in her face.</p>
<p>I would have given anything--my ten fingers, my next quarter's allowance, my new Sunday bonnet--to have prevented the answering flush which painfully flooded my face, from my forehead to my chin. I pretended to look away out of the window.</p>
<p>"Yes ?" I said; and a sick, miserable wretchedness came into my heart. She was going to tell me of her love, and of his.</p>
<p>"Here, take the note, and read it quickly," she said, thrusting in into my hand.</p>
<p>I pushed her back almost angrily.</p>
<p>"I--I read it?" I cried, in dismay; and then I stifled down my emotion, and added, in a tranquil voice, "I don't think you ought to show it me, Helen. Mr Warner would not like it."</p>
<p>"Not like it!" laughed Helen back. "Well, considering that the note is entirely about you, and that I am to have the answering of it for you, I think the least you can do is to take the trouble to read it."</p>
<p>Wondering, trembling, with a strange new beating at my heart, I took the letter from her hand, opened it, and read,--</p>
<p>"DEAR NELL,--I can get twenty-four hours' leave next week, I think. I have a great mind to run down to you for the night. Will you ask Miss Orchester to say whether I shall do so or no? I shall not come if she will not make it worth my while. Tell her she is to decide.--Your affectionate cousin, FRANK."</p>
<p>I sat quite still in a bewilderment of happiness. So it was me after all that he loved! I could not raise my eyes to hers, and my face burned and glowed, the little note shook in my trembling hands.</p>
<p>"Well?" cried Helen joyously.</p>
<p>"Oh! Helen, is it true?" I whispered softly.</p>
<p>"Quite true, you little goose!" she answered, kissing me. "Everybody saw it but yourself."</p>
<p>"But, Helen," I said wonderingly, "who would have thought it, when you were there, that any man would have looked at me?"</p>
<p>"I declare, Maggie, your modesty concerning yourself is so utterly irrational and unwomanlike that it makes me angry! Well, am I to say yes? Tell me quick. Fred will be back, and I must be off. Is he to come?"</p>
<p>"Oh! of course," I answered, smiling; and then she kissed me again, and Fred came in with the slippers.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she had her boots up again, from the kitchen fire, and started off home through the rain, accompanied by Fred, who insisted upon
walking back with her.</p>
<p>"I have letters to write, so I can't stop," she said, laughing and nodding to me as she went, and I was left alone.</p>
<p>Alone with my happiness; for I realised now, all at once, that I loved him. I suppose he had loved me all the time, only I had not dared to think it. When I came to look back at that fortnight last Easter that he had spent with the Marsdens, when Fred and I were with them every day, a hundred little things which I had scarcely noticed at the time came back to me now with a new significance. There were looks, and tones of his voice, and half-finished sentences, which should have taught me the truth had I read them aright. How was it that I had misunderstood them all? Was it only that I was a novice to love's signals, or was it that I was indeed modest to an unwomanly degree, as Helen had said?</p>
<p>As I sat alone gathered up in the window-sill, with my chin in my hands, full of these reveries, I suddenly caught sight of a closed fly coming up the avenue. I watched it curiously. It came up to the house, and stopped there, and it was empty. It had evidently been ordered from the town. I sat still and waited.</p>
<p>Presently, to my surprise, a portmanteau was brought out, and placed on the top of it. It was Mr Hardcastle's.</p>
<p>I jumped up joyfully. He was going, then! I ran into the passage, and hung eagerly over the bannisters. Below in the hall papa was wishing him good-bye. He stood all ready to start, with coat and hat in his hands, and shook hands with my father. I wondered whether he would ask to say good-bye to me. My father looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to hurry you, but if you want to catch the train--"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know, I must be off."</p>
<p>He shook hands again, and moved to the door. Then suddenly he made a step back, and laid his hand impressively on my father's arm.</p>
<p>"Remember," he said, "she must not be told of it till I write ;" and the next minute he was gone.</p>
<p>I went back thoughtfully into my attic. Who was <em>she</em>, I wondered, and what was it that was not to be told to her?</p>
