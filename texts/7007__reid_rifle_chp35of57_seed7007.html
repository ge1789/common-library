<!-- chapter title: "The Cobra-di-Capello" -->
<p>Up to this moment my intention had been engrossed with the contents 
of the note, and I had no thought of looking outward. I raised myself on
 tiptoe, stretching my neck as far as I could into the embrasure.</p>
<p>A golden sunlight was pouring down upon broad, green leaves, where 
the palms grew wildly. Red vines hung in festoons, like curtains of 
scarlet satin. There were bands of purple and violet—the maroon-coloured
 morus, and the snowy flowers of the magnolia—a glittering opal. 
Orange-trees, with white, wax-like flowers, were bending under their 
golden globes. The broad plumes of the corozo palm curved gracefully 
over, their points trailing downwards, and without motion.</p>
<p>A clump of these grew near, their naked stems laced by a parasite of 
the lliana species, which rose from the earth, and, traversing 
diagonally, was lost in the feathery frondage above. These formed a 
canopy, underneath which, from tree to tree, three hammocks were 
extended. One was empty; the other two were occupied. The elliptical 
outlines, traceable through the gauzy network of Indian grass, proved 
that the occupants were females.</p>
<p>Their faces were turned from me. They lay motionless: they were asleep.</p>
<p>As I stood gazing upon this picture, the occupant of the nearest 
hammock awoke, and turning, with a low murmur upon her lips, again fell 
asleep. Her face was now towards me. My heart leaped, and my whole frame
 quivered with emotion. I recognised the features of Guadalupe Rosales.</p>
<p>One limb, cased in silk, had fallen over the selvage of her pendent 
couch, and hung negligently down. The small satin slipper had dropped 
off, and was lying on the ground. Her head rested upon a silken pillow, 
and a band of her long black hair, that had escaped from the comb, 
straggling over the cords of the hammock, trailed along the grass. Her 
bosom rose with a gentle heaving above the network as she breathed and 
slept.</p>
<p>My heart was full of mixed emotions—surprise, pleasure, love, pain. 
Yes, pain; for she could thus sleep—sleep sweetly, tranquilly—while I, 
within a few paces of her couch, was bound and brutally treated!</p>
<p>“Yes, she can sleep!” I muttered to myself, as my chagrin predominated in the tumult of emotions. “Ha! heavens!”</p>
<p>My attention was attracted from the sleeper to a fearful object. I 
had noticed a spiral-like appearance upon the lliana. It had caught my 
eye once or twice while looking at the sleeper; but I had not dwelt upon
 it, taking it for one vine twined round another—a peculiarity often met
 with in the forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>A bright sparkle now attracted my eye; and, on looking at the object 
attentively, I discovered, to my horror, that the spiral protuberance 
upon the vine was nothing else than the folds of a snake! Squeezing 
himself silently down the parasite—for he had come from above—the 
reptile slowly uncoiled two or three of the lowermost rings, and 
stretched his glistening neck horizontally over the hammock. Now, for 
the first time, I perceived the horned protuberance on his head, and 
recognised the dreaded reptile—the <i>macaurel</i> (the <i>cobra</i> of America).</p>
<p>In this position he remained for some moments, perfectly motionless, 
his neck proudly curved like that of a swan, while his head was not 
twelve inches from the face of the sleeper. I fancied that I could see 
the soft down upon her lip playing under his breath!</p>
<p>He now commenced slowly vibrating from side to side, while a low, 
hissing sound proceeded from his open jaws. His horns projected out, 
adding to the hideousness of his appearance; and at intervals his forked
 tongue shot forth, glancing in the sun like a purple diamond.</p>
<p>He appeared to be gloating over his victim, in the act of charming 
her to death. I even fancied that her lips moved, and her head began to 
stir backward and forward, following the oscillations of the reptile.</p>
<p>All this I witnessed without the power to move. My soul as well as my
 body was chained; but, even had I been free, I could have offered no 
help. I knew that the only hope of her safety lay in silence. Unless 
disturbed and angered, the snake might not bite; but was he not at that 
moment distilling some secret venom upon her lips?</p>
<p>“Oh, Heaven!” I gasped out, in the intensity of my fears, “is this 
the fiend himself? She moves!—now he will strike! Not yet—she is still 
again. Now—now!—mercy! she trembles!—the hammock shakes—she is quivering
 under the fascin— Ha!”</p>
<p>A shot rang from the walls—the snake suddenly jerked back his 
head—his rings flew out, and he fell to the earth, writhing as if in 
pain!</p>
<p>The girls started with a scream, and sprang simultaneously from their hammocks.</p>
<p>Grasping each other by the hand, with terrified looks they rushed from the spot and disappeared.</p>
<p>Several men ran up, ending the snake with their sabres. One of them 
stooped, and examining the carcase of the dead reptile, exclaimed:</p>
<p>“<i>Carai</i>! there is a hole in his head—he has been shot!”</p>
<p>A moment after, half a dozen of the guerilleros burst open the door and rushed in, crying out as they entered:</p>
<p>“<i>Quien tira</i>?” (Who fired?)</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” angrily asked Raoul, who had been in ill-humour 
ever since the guerillero had refused him a draught of water.</p>
<p>“I ask you who fired the shot?” repeated the man.</p>
<p>“Fired the shot!” echoed Raoul, knowing nothing of what had occurred 
outside. “We look like firing a shot, don’t we? If I possessed that 
power, my gay friend, the first use I should make of it would be to send
 a bullet through that clumsy skull of yours.”</p>
<p>“<i>Santissima</i>!” ejaculated the Mexican, with a look of astonishment. “It could not be these—they are all tied!”</p>
<p>And the Mexicans passed out again, leaving us to our reflections.</p>
