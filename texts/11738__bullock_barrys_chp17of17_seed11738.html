<!-- Chapter XVII -->
<p>
It was nearing seven o’clock when they started for Camberwell. The night was chill, gloomy; the pavements were foul and slippery; there was no sky, no stars; like ghosts wandering forlorn through dreary passages in some unspeakable hell, sped the figures of the passers-by.
</p>
<p>
Though he was well muffled, and wrapped warm in Rab’s overcoat, Frank, stepping quick into the raw air, shivered and started coughing. It was distressing to hear him. Time and again he had to stop, fighting for breath. “Oh, Lord, Lord,” he would say, with a gasp; “this will kill me.”
</p>
<p>
“How long have you been like that?” asked Rab, in a while. “Only a week or so? Well, you’ve got something that’s a week too old. Here,” said Rab, turning along the Strand; “let’s go and have a bit to eat.”
</p>
<p>
A cutlet and his share of a bottle of wine, worked wonders with Frank; stopped his cough, brought colour and life to his cheeks; presently, sent him stepping firmly and buoyantly — for they had decided to go on foot — along the pavement, and over the dreary length of Waterloo Bridge. And Rab, striding silently beside him, was glad at the change; glad as it was possible for mortal man with thoughts and inside his cloak just then to be. “It’s bad enough,” he said to himself; “but not too bad. Thank the good God I’ve found him in time.”
</p>
<p>
At first, Frank said little; but, once they had crossed the river and were come to the glories of Waterloo Road, his tongue loosened and he fell to questioning Rab about the Dad. How was the old man? How was he taking the blow? How had the blow come?
</p>
<p>
“Surely it was the last thing in the world,” said Frank, “I expected to happen. A man like that, slaving his faithfullest for the wages of a boy! Surely, it’s cruel.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s cruel,” answered Rab; “but so is the end of most things. And surely, of all men living, cruelty comes hardest to him. He expected so little, gave so much; asked nothing but to keep his delusions to the end. Even now he hopes, sits yonder below the pear tree, telling himself that it’s all a dream. But it isn’t. The dear old man! There’s no hope at all. I’ve been to see. They said simply, those men of sawdust, that his place was wanted; they were sorry, but so it was.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor old Dad,” said Frank. “It will kill him, Rab. It must be like tearing out his heart. But wait! Oh, I’ll work. I’ll make amends for all I’ve cost him... . Rab, I have an idea. Do you think we could all manage together, the five of us, in the Dad’s little house? It would be like old times. The garden might save him. I could manage. Oh, I’ll work! I’ll make amends. I’ll let them all see... . Eh, Rab? What do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I think with you, Frank. And I hope—” Rab paused. He dared not hope much. Frank’s plan was good, his resolves worthy; but what of Frank himself? Had he learnt his lesson? Had he strength to face all that was before him, that future which lay out there, dark and very troubled? Rab hoped so. He prayed so. But who could tell? “I think with you, Frank,” he said. “And I hope for the best.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” cried Frank. “I’m so glad. Ah, it’s well to feel like this. Rab, Rab, I’ve been in hell these last few weeks. Ah, what I’ve suffered! But now. ...”
</p>
<p>
Like that Frank talked, and strode along, full of hope, of contrition, finding his old self, bit by bit, at every step; after a while, raising his eyes and finding himself in the pastures of Walworth, changed his tone and began talking of Marian. </p>
<p>
How was she? he asked. Ah, he wanted to see her so. All that of a while ago had been only talk. Down in his heart, always and very greatly he had loved Marian. Five months ago, the leaving her, the keeping from her, had been terrible. Only a word he had wanted to bring him flying to her. But she had sent none. “Why was it, Rab? Why, long ago, did she not send?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps she was waiting for you to come, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, maybe so. But I had vowed that she should send. And she did not. Then, I grew bitter, indifferent; then, the devil seemed to clutch me... . but always, Rab, even at my shamefullest, always I was thinking of Marian, of her and the boy. I fought against the thought. I wouldn’t admit to myself  that I cared a straw. But I did. Rab,” said Frank, halting for a step; “you believe that, don’t you? You know it?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe it, Frank. I know it.”
</p>
<p>
“And she? Does she, Rab, believe it?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s for her to tell you, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes. Ah, she will believe me,” cried Frank, and once more turned his face, his shining face, for home and Marian. “I’ll make her,” said he, speeding through the mirk along Walworth’s dreary pavements. “Come along, Rab; come along. ... But you’re sure, Rab?” he asked, stopping again. “Tell me. You’re quite sure she wants me as much as —? You’re sure, Rab?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m certain, Frank. Oh, man, man, don’t you know it!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I know. And you say she has written, and has been looking herself for me? Then — then —” Frank pondered a moment. “Tell me, Rab. Why should the change come now? Why did she not write four weeks ago, five weeks ago?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ask her, Frank,” cried Rab. “How should I know? Wait, Frank,” pleaded Rab, as one pleads with a child. “It’s only a little longer.”
</p>
<p>
“Only a little longer,” repeated Frank. “Yes; we’re getting nearer. How often I’ve trod these shining sidewalks. Ah, the squalor, the horrible gloom! Look at the people, Rab; look at the shops —” He paused; stopped: just across the way was East Street. East Street? Down there lived the Butlers, lived Sarah, and John, and Nan. Nan? Was Nan living there now? And — and — Turning, he took Rab’s arm; walked a yard or two; then: “Rab,” said he, “just one word more. Has anyone — a girl — been to see Marian within this last month?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“And Marian saw her?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“And then Marian wrote?”
</p>
<p>
“Frank — Oh, man, man,” cried Rab, “why ask me these things? How should I know?” He laid a hand on Frank’s arm. “Be patient, lad; be patient. The wife will tell you — tell everything. What I know of Nan Butler is not very much; but —” </p>
<p>
“Finish, Rab; just that.”
</p>
<p>
“She might be Marian’s sister,” said Rab: and said no more.
</p>
<p>
They skirted the whirlpool of the Gate; left behind them all the turmoil, the gloom of Walworth, and entered the confines of Camberwell: and now, home and Marian being almost in sight, did Frank’s blood quicken and his tongue run free. Let them hurry. He was so glad. The night it was! Think of the past miserable weeks, think of two hours ago even; and now he was coming back, coming home! Soon he should see them; soon have Marian in his arms, and the boy on his knee. Let Rab come along. Ah, he was so glad! How could he help it? It was like sighting Heaven from the portals of Purgatory.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Rab; come,” said Frank, taking Rab’s arm. “Man, the boy will be in bed if we don’t hurry! See; here’s Wyndham Road. We’re almost there; oh, come along! Why are you dallying so? I want wings. If you only knew how I want to see him! For five months I haven’t set eyes on him, five long months. All I had was a photograph, that and my thoughts. And how I’ve thought! Rab, as God’s above me, I believe thinking of him kept me from damnation... . What’s the matter, Rab? What is it, old man?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s — nothing; it’s nothing.” Rab paused. “Frank,” he went on, ” I’ve something —” Again Rab paused. “Frank, you remember what I said about setting up an idol in your heart. It’s wrong, Frank; it’s a sin; you’ll be punished for it someday.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” cried Frank. “I can’t help the future. It’s now; it’s now! He is my idol. I want him. I want him. I want to feel him, to hold him — Let me go,” cried Frank, shaking off Rab’s hand. “I’m not going to hear you. I don’t care. I don’t care. See; here’s the Road... . No; I won’t listen. Damn you, come along! ... Then stay there; I’m off.”
</p>
<p>
They were now in Leipsic Road. No one was near. Heavy hung the November gloom on road and pavement. Frank started running. Rab followed, calling, “Frank, Frank — wait, lad, wait — Frank, lad, just a word;” then, getting no heed, ceased running and stood panting on the pavement, his hands clenched on his breast and his voice going, “Ah, my God! ... I couldn’t; I couldn’t... . Ah, lad, lad!”
</p>
<p>
But Frank ran on; came to the green gate; rushed in and knocked hard on the door. How long they were! He knocked again, panting the while and fighting a burst of coughing. Hark. Yes. At last!
</p>
<p>
“Why, Dad, my son! How are you, Dad? I’m back. I’m back!” He caught the Dad’s hand and wrung it. “But where’s Marian? And the Mother? And the boy? Oh, I know; I know!” Not a chance did he give the Dad, standing shrunken there in his Pensioner’s broadcloth, to speak; not a second look did he give at the Dad’s haggard old face. Like a flash he was along the passage, calling, “Marian, Marian;” like a flash was through the doorway and into the little parlour, arms out, voice crying and calling, “Marian, Marian! Here I am!”
</p>
<p>
Across the room, Marian, all in black, was coming, a flush on her face, joy shining in the pity and sorrow of her eyes. Just risen from her chair by the fire, stood the Mother, in black also and big with tears. And on the table, in black-edged envelopes, were cards, bearing the emblem of a dove and the name of the boy.
