<title>Chapter 103 of The Man of Many Daughters by Clara de Chatelain</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p>
After this great commotion, there followed a lull in the family annals that lasted about three years, during
which scarcely any events occurred worth noting, unless we briefly mention that Viscountess Randal brought
her husband a son and heir, and that the Rev. Algernon Temple had been promoted to a rectorship in the vicinity
of London, through his cousin Lord Randal’s good offices. In leaving the much cherished white house, the
scene of their early happiness, the young couple did not grow more ambitious nor more worldly-minded, but
solicitude for their infant family, at present consisting of two little girls, made them accept with heartfelt
gratitude a removal which brought them ampler revenues, while it placed the zealous rector in a wider sphere
of usefulness.
</p>
<p>
The Dowager Lady Randal, who had lived rather more quietly than formerly during the above-mentioned period,
now again opened her drawing-rooms to the fashionable world for the sake of introducing Lady Rosamond, whose
education was completed, and who quite justified her prophecy that she would be the beauty of the family.
Fortunately, the qualities of the heart and mind were equal to the charming exterior that impressed everyone
so favourably. Lady Randal had allowed Miss Sloman to instil into her pupil’s mind those solid principles,
the want of which had proved Geraldine’s ruin, and had forborne overlaying her work with the tinsel of
frivolities, by removing the young and tender plant into the hot-house atmosphere of the polite world at
too early a period. Rosamond had therefore ripened without the aid of moral guano, too often applied in the
present system of education—and it was not till she was about eighteen that she emerged into the full blaze
of a London season. It seemed as if Lady Randal’s careful bringing up of Rosamond had been intended as a
kind of atonement for her lamentable failure in Geraldine’s case; and she certainly reaped the fruits of
her conscientious efforts, for not only could she look upon her work with pride, but Rosamond’s affectionate
disposition, so different from Geraldine’s fawning and interested professions, had consoled her for the loss
of her former favourite, and made her love this amiable girl as her own daughter.
</p>
<p>
The Earl of Sherrydown, who had been so completely bowed down with shame and mortification ever since Lady
Geraldine’s elopement (an event which he once assured Lord Ravensborough had never before taken place in the
Godalmin family, all the female branches of which had been patterns of propiety—a great consolation truly
to the injured peer!) as to cease crowing about his illustrious house, now once more raised his fallen crest,
and trusted that his blooming sixth daughter would compensate for past disappointments, and that she would
grace a coronet, not only by her beauty but by her virtues. For the silly nobleman, unable to learn experience
from the past, was again dreaming about a Duke or at least a Marquis for Rosamond, and would willingly have
sacrificed her to the first addle-pated booby of high birth who might have asked for her hand. He was
therefore grievously disappointed when the Dowager Lady Randal, accompanied by Walter, drove one day to
his house, and informed him with a smile, that she had come as an ambassador, to prepare him for the visit
of a young man who was desirous of the honour of waiting upon him, and asking him for Lady Rosamond’s hand.
</p>
<p>
The Earl at first looked bland, and judging from this overture that Lady Randal approved of the suitor, and
that consequently he was of suitable rank and fortune, enquired to what family he belonged.
</p>
<p>
“He is the son of an old friend of yours,” said he ladyship—”can’t you guess who?”
</p>
<p>
The Earl was no hand at guessing, and never had been, he therefore begged her ladyship to enlighten him.
</p>
<p>
“Why your old friend Mark Everingham’s son, Julius, who returned from the East about a twelvemonth since,”
replied Lady Randal.
</p>
<p>
The pleased expression faded away from his lordship’s countenance, and he observed querulously that this
was not the sort of marriage that he had anticipated for Lady Rosamond.
</p>
<p>
“But you’ve not seen him yet, uncle, as you don’t go into general society,” observed Lord Randal, “therefore
you can’t in reason condemn him till he’s been “trotted out” for your inspection. And I can assure you he
is not only a very handsome fellow, but a man of superior mind and great intellect.”
</p>
<p>
“And, you may add, most amiable too, Walter,” said his stepmother; “besides which,” continued she, turning
to the Earl, “he is not only rich now, but will be very wealthy some day.”
</p>
<p>
“He is, of course, only <em>Mr.</em> Everingham,” observed the Earl—”even supposing his family to be ancient.”
</p>
<p>
“And, pray brother, did not I marry plain Mr. Denison?” said Lady Randal, warmly.
</p>
<p>
The Earl thought: “Ay—but that’s very different. You are not a Godalmin.” But all he allowed to ooze out
of this view of the subject amounted to: “Possibly, sister, but he was at least the Honourable Mr. Denison.”
</p>
<p>
“Whereas poor Julius is only honourable in fact, and has not the privilege to label himself “Honourable,” as
we put ‘poison’ on a bottle of laudanum, or ‘beware of spring guns’ at the entry of a park,” said Lord
Randal—”how mortifying it must be to possess only the genuine article, when a scamp like Sackville can
write himself I am an honourable, and still be licensed to commit every crime in the decalogue.”
</p>
<p>
The Earl winced painfully at the name of Sackville, and thought it most prudent not to enter the lists
against his nephew.
</p>
<p>
“Julius is quite the lion of the season,” resumed Lady Randal, “and is received and <em>fêté</em> by
the first people in the land. Julius is admitted by those best informed in such matters, to be the rising
man of the day—he is reckoned highly talented in diplomatic circles, and I was lately told that it is
very likely that owing to his knowledge of Oriental languages, he may be sent out, if not as an ambassador,
at least on some mission of very great importance.”
</p>
<p>
“Although nothing could compensate in the Earl’s eyes for the want of the only quality which is nobody’s
merit, viz. :— high birth, still considering that after the lamentable failure of Geraldine’s grand
marriage, he was rather out of elbows in point of arguments for proving that Rosamond’s happiness
imperatively required her to be united to a peer of the realm, considering too that Lady Randal declared
it to be her intention to leave the bulk of her property to Rosamond and Henrietta, adding: “I say this
before Walter, who, being amply provided for, is far too generous to feel the slightest displeasure at
my providing for those whom I almost look upon as my own daughters.”—The Earl we say felt compelled
to give up the point, and to declare that he would “withdraw his opposition, since her ladyship seemed
to wish it.”
</p>
<p>
Julius Everingham was in consequence introduced to the Earl by Lord Randal, who kindly volunteered to
smooth all the difficulties of the first interview by his presence, taking as he did a warm interest
in his cousin Rosamond’s happiness, seeing that she cared nothing about her lover’s rent-roll. Julius
was, as Walter said, very handsome, having an Oriental cast of features, which were set off to still
greater advantage by his having adopted the fez during his long residence abroad. He had likewise a
good deal of the Oriental gravity about him, which gave a weight and dignity to all he said. There was
perhaps rather too great a difference of years between himself and his lady love, Julius being upwards
of thirty; still as Rosamond was herself of a thoughtful cast of mind, and looked a year or two older than
she really was, the disparity would scarcely strike a casual beholder. Altogether he made a favourable
impression rather than the reverse on the stiff old Earl, possibly just because he retrenched himself
behing the frigid rampart of Oriental dignity. Julius must feel himself called to some very high destiny,
thus reasoned his lordship, by his not assuming a more humble attitude towards the arbiter of his happiness.
</p>
<p>
After the consent was given, Lord Sherrydown enquired coldly after Julius’s father, when the son informed
him he had gone to America on business, but that he would write off the welcome intelligence to him, which
he hoped would bring him back to Europe in time to be present at his marriage. The now happy lover wrote
off by the next packet a long letter full of his rapturous love for Rosamond, which gladdened honest Mark
Everingham’s heart, while over and above his joy at finding his son had consoled himself for former
disappointments, he chuckled to think that his proud friend’s “nose was brought to the grindstone” (as
he expressed it in homely terms) so far as to tolerate a match between their children. But alas! the good
father did not live to congratulate his son, being carried off by a fever within a few days after the
receipt of this cheering letter, and before he put pen to paper to answer it.
</p>
<p>
The afflicting news brought by the next mail of course suspended the marriage, which would otherwise
have taken place in a few weeks. Julius was now a wealthy capitalist, but unlike many wealthy heirs, he
had a heart to feel what he had lost, rather than a money grasping spirit to count up what he gained in
the way of riches. He truly mourned his father, with whom he had lived but little it is true, but to whose
advice and kindness he had always referred most trustfully throughout his career. Another amiable feature
in Julius’s character was likewise brought into relief by this sad event. On opening Mark Everingham’s
will, to which a codicil was added, bearing the date of the year when he had visited his old friend in
Lancashire, it was found that he bequeathed twenty thousand pounds to the first daughter of Lord
Sherrydown’s who should marry a commoner with her father’s consent. According to this clause, Julius would
certainly have been entitled to claim this amount being handed over to Rosamond, but he insisted most
generously that it should be put by to serve as a marriage portion for Henrietta, contending that it would
be taking an unfair advantage if he allowed it to return to himself, and would look to the eyes of the world
as if he had been secretly cognizant of his father’s intentions, and had wooed Lady Rosamond from interested
motives instead of the purest affection.
</p>
<p>
This noble conduct delighted the Dowager Lady Randal; and even the Earl, whom she informed of his
determination, was forced to confess that “it was highly honourable on Mr. Everingham’s part.”
</p>
<p>
Before the period of mourning was over, Julius received the appointment Lady Randal had alluded to. It was
a diplomatic mission investing him almost with the character of an ambassador extraordinary to the Court
of Persia. As, in all probability, he was to be absent for a year or eighteen months, he naturally wished
to secure his happiness before his departure, and was, as naturally, desirous that the chosen of his heart
should share his honours with him. He therefore urged on Lady Rosamond and her protectress to hasten the
epoch of their marriage, as circumstances fully justified his shortening the period his filial respect had
originally intended to consecrate to his father’s memory. “Never put off your business for a private affair,”
had always been a favourite maxim with Mark Everingham; and Julius felt that if it be given to our lost ones
to take glimpses of what is passing here below, his father would approve his not giving up his appointment,
and consequently no longer deferring his marriage.
</p>
<p>
It was however to be a quiet wedding, both on account of Julius’s position and to meet Rosamond’s wishes
on the subject. She shrunk with alarm from the glare and glitter she had witnessed at Geraldine’s pompous
nuptials, but wished to be surrounded by those she loved. She insisted, too, with the superstitious
feelings of a tender heart, to be married not by special license in Lady Randal’s drawingroom as Geraldine
had been, but in their parish church, like less exalted persons. It seemed in short, as if it would bring
better luck, to do everything differently from what had been done on the occasion when her heartless
sister gave her hand to the man she professed not to love.
</p>
<p>
At length the costly outfit (for the Dowager Lady Randal was determined it should equal if not surpass
the one she had bestowed on Geraldine) was completed, and a number of presents had been offered to
Rosamond who was a general favourite, when the solemn Earl of Sherrydown came to deliver into her hands
the jewels of the house of Godalmin, consisting of the bracelets we already know, which he accompanied
by a formal allocution, in which he charged her to guard these relics more jealously than her sister
had done, so as to hand them down unsullied to her descendants as became a daughter of their illustrious
line, <em>although</em> about to unite herself to a commoner, as he could not refrain from observing.
</p>
<p>
After Rosamond had replied by a few sensible words to her father’s lengthy harangue, two young friends
who were to act as her bridesmaids having come in, Lady Randal begged the Earl to walk into her boudoir,
wishing to converse with him on a family topic. As soon as they were seated, her ladyship said: “Before
we fix the day, I wish to inform you, brother, that we all wish the ceremony to be performed by the Rev.
Algernon Temple.”
</p>
<p>
The Earl bowed, and swallowed the unwelcome pill without making a face—at least outwardly.
</p>
<p>
“And Rosamond is also desirous of inviting her sisters and their husbands to her wedding,” resumed
Lady Randal, like a member of parliament trying to slip another clause into his Bill, when he sees
the House favourably disposed.
</p>
<p>
But here the opposition flamed out. “Am I to understand your ladyship that all the husbands of my
daughters are to be invited?” said the Earl, knitting his brows.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, all your sons-in-law,” said Lady Randal, bravely.
</p>
<p>
We may perceive that her ladyship had made many steps in the right direction since Geraldine’s ill-starred
match. Her heart, as we have already had occasion to remark, was good at the bottom, and she had the sense
to progress with the age she lived in to a certain degree. The many prejudices that she had carefully
fostered during her long colonial residence, as being the very essence of high breeding, she now found to
be rather out of date, in the midst of the on ward movement enforced on the privileged classes, whether
they like it or not, by the spirit that is abroad. Moreover, the moral contact with a character like
Walter’s had done her worlds of good. She had begun by quarrelling with her stepson, and debating inch
by inch the very propositions she had ended by adopting; but not being encrusted with the impenetrable
pride that made Lord Sherrydown ridiculous, when he was not odious, she had gradually thrown down of
her own accord the selfsame ramparts Walter had been battering at so unsuccessfully in the first instance,
and successively raised her veto upon Lady Jane—and lastly even on Lady Eleanor, and more meritorious
still, on Frank Armitage. It is true the latter had bought a fine estate near Manchester, and was now
only a sleeping partner in the firm, and having been returned a member for his native city, by the last
election, spent the parliamentary season in London. He was therefore <em>unupholstered</em> to a certain degree,
and his original sin was cancelled in all eyes but those of <em>ultrà</em> exclusives like the Earl. But Lady
Randal had forgiven him even before this white-washing process had taken place—we shall see why presently.
And to sum up the culminating weight in the scale, which caused Lady Randal to stand to her guns so
unflinchingly, was the grudge she still owed the Earl for twitting Julius with being plain <em>Mr.</em>
She felt it due to Mr. Denison’s memory not to forgive him lightly.
</p>
<p>
“Then, if that is the case,” said the Earl—”I—that is your ladyship—must excuse me—but I must delegate
to another the office of giving away my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
“Walter would of course be ready to officiate, or one of her brothers-in-law either,” said her ladyship,
“but I believe Rosamond would prefer that her father performed a parent’s natural duty on this solemn
occasion.”
</p>
<p>
A sudden panic seized the Earl that his nephew would be capable of suggesting that Frank Armitage should
be invested with this office—and how that would read in the <em>Morning Post!</em> The blood of the
Godalmins boiled up at the thought, but he tried to say as pacifically as possible: “Your ladyship must
perceive that, however I should regret renouncing my privilege of giving Lady Rosamond away—certain
proprieties forbid that—I should meet certain persons”—
</p>
<p>
“He is no longer an upholsterer, brother,” said Lady Randal, quietly; “and even if he were,” added she,
with a slight tremor in her voice, “he has shown himself a gentleman, and a christian in the best sense
of the word, as Algernon Temple says, in his conduct to our poor misguided Geraldine—indeed, all your
children behaved beautifully on that occasion, and you ought to feel proud of them and theirs.”
</p>
<p>
The Earl looked at her ladyship enquiringly. His anger at Geraldine for having disgraced the family
had prevented his enquiring what had been her ultimate fate. But the unjust partiality he once harboured
for her, overcoming momentarily his feelings of resentment, he listened with interest to the account
given him by Lady Randal, which amounted briefly to this:—When the heartless Captain Sackville had
abandoned Geraldine, who had already parted with many of her jewels to supply his gambling propensities,
the unfortunate woman found herself in debt, in a miserable lodging in Brussels, having been obliged to
leave the fine hotel where she had put up at first, to conceal herself from her numerous creditors.
Frank Armitage happened at the time to be in Belgium, whither he had gone to attend a sale of fine
old Flemish furniture, accompanied by Lady Eleanor, to whom the trip was an enjoyment. They recognized
Lady Geraldine in the street, and judging from her dress and dejected countenance that the tinsel
illusions of guilt had already turned to dross upon her hands, they accosted her kindly, spoke soothing
words to her wounded spirit, and encouraged her to tell them her troubles. Nor was the kindness of these
good Samaritans restricted to words alone. Lady Eleanor, forgetting she had been turned out of her
sister’s house, and cut by her in the park, took Geraldine back to the hotel at which they were
staying, and gave up all amusements during her stay in Brussels, to minister to this ‘mind diseased,’
which even in its errors had not the genuine humility of repentance, but was chafed rather than touched
by the kindness she received. Meantime Armitage settled the claims of her various creditors, and
redeemed such of her ornaments as were pawned; after which the excellent couple brought her back
to England, where Norman, on being consulted by Frank, willingly pointed out the steps Lady Geraldine
was to take to obtain an allowance for her support, although, as we know, he subsequently declined
defending her legally.
</p>
<p>
As, unfortunately, Geraldine was not reformed, no sooner was she in possession of a comfortable
independence after the divorce, than she followed Septimus to the Isle of Wight, whither she had
heard he had gone on leaving England, and a momentary reconciliation took place between them, as
the Captain happened to be short of cash, and for a week or two she paraded her infamy boldly in
the very place where she had been seen and known as Lady Ravensborough. But again her fickle paramour
left her. Her sisters who had been watching for the favourable moment to attempt to rescue her from
this life of scandal, having heard of her present position, agreed to interfere. The Rev. Algernon
Temple and Lady Beatrice went over to try and reclaim her. As her quarter’s dividend was exhausted,
Geraldine listened to the clergyman’s exhortations, and agreed to go back to London with them. Being
obliged to wait for a vessel, the clergyman and his wife removed Geraldine to another part of the
island, and the day before they sailed Algernon proposed a walk to the two ladies, and led them
within sight of Lord Ravensborough’s marine villa. Geraldine started at the sight. “Be easy,” said
the clergyman, “there are no servants here that know your ladyship. The house is on sale, and I have
obtained a card, and wish you to enter it once more.” Geraldine dared not refuse, and drawing her
veil over her face, she entered. On visiting the rooms they found in his lordship’s plainly furnished
private study the only ornament was a splendidly painted full-length portrait of Lady Geraldine,
placed opposite his writing table. Geraldine had not seen it since she had sat for the face, the
accessories having been finished after her elopement. It had been painted with the view of having it
engraved for the Book of Beauty—where, of course, she could never now figure as the Countess of
Ravensborough.
</p>
<p>
“Is this a fancy portrait—and to be sold with the furniture?” enquired Algernon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh dear no, sir,” said the man who showed the house; “it is the picture of my lady <em>that was</em>, and it
was to be removed before the house was shown, according to my lord’s orders, only as the packing case
was not ready I didn’t think I ought to refuse to let you see the place—for my lord wishes to sell
it, I know.”
</p>
<p>
On looking at her picture, which had now become a flattered likeness, and thinking of the brilliant
position she had lost—she who lived on vanity and display—a sharp pang entered Lady Geraldine’s
heart, and she grasped Algernon’s arm convulsively to draw him away. The clergyman thanked the man for
his trouble, and the little party immediately withdrew. He made no comments, but allowed Geraldine’s
reflexions to work silently upon her mind. After leaving the island, she became more tractable, and at
length suffered the Temples to take her over to Brittany, where the Mortfontaines offered her an asylum.
The Count and Countess kindly put at her disposal a pavilion in their grounds, and there the once
fashionable and dissipated Geraldine was living in strict retirement—seeing no one but the members of
her own family who occasionally visited Margaret, including Lord Randal and his wife.
</p>
<p>
After detailing all these facts, Lady Randal again asked the Earl whether he still refused to come
to his daughter’s wedding—at the risk of meeting these objectionable persons, who had shown such
mercy and charitable feelings towards a fallen sister, adding: “I am sorry to have to introduce this
painful subject at a festive moment—but you forced me to do so, brother.”
</p>
<p>
The Earl stammered out that he would turn the matter over in his mind, and give her ladyship an answer.
