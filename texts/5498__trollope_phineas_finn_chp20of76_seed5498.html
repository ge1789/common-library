<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- Chapter XX<br>THE DEBATE ON THE BALLOT -->
<p>
Phineas took his seat in the House with a consciousness of much
inward trepidation of heart on that night of the ballot debate. After
leaving Lord Chiltern he went down to his club and dined alone. Three
or four men came and spoke to him; but he could not talk to them at
his ease, nor did he quite know what they were saying to him. He
was going to do something which he longed to achieve, but the very
idea of which, now that it was so near to him, was a terror to him.
To be in the House and not to speak would, to his thinking, be a
disgraceful failure. Indeed, he could not continue to keep his seat
unless he spoke. He had been put there that he might speak. He would
speak. Of course he would speak. Had he not already been conspicuous
almost as a boy orator? And yet, at this moment he did not know
whether he was eating mutton or beef, or who was standing opposite to
him and talking to him, so much was he in dread of the ordeal which
he had prepared for himself. As he went down to the House after
dinner, he almost made up his mind that it would be a good thing to
leave London by one of the night mail trains. He felt himself to be
stiff and stilted as he walked, and that his clothes were uneasy to
him. When he turned into Westminster Hall he regretted more keenly
than ever he had done that he had seceded from the keeping of Mr.
Low. He could, he thought, have spoken very well in court, and would
there have learned that self-confidence which now failed him so
terribly. It was, however, too late to think of that. He could only
go in and take his seat.
</p>
<p>
He went in and took his seat, and the chamber seemed to him to be
mysteriously large, as though benches were crowded over benches, and
galleries over galleries. He had been long enough in the House to
have lost the original awe inspired by the Speaker and the clerks of
the House, by the row of Ministers, and by the unequalled importance
of the place. On ordinary occasions he could saunter in and out, and
whisper at his ease to a neighbour. But on this occasion he went
direct to the bench on which he ordinarily sat, and began at once to
rehearse to himself his speech. He had in truth been doing this all
day, in spite of the effort that he had made to rid himself of all
memory of the occasion. He had been collecting the heads of his
speech while Mr. Low had been talking to him, and refreshing his
quotations in the presence of Lord Chiltern and the dumb-bells. He
had taxed his memory and his intellect with various tasks, which,
as he feared, would not adjust themselves one with another. He had
learned the headings of his speech, — so that one heading might follow
the other, and nothing be forgotten. And he had learned verbatim the
words which he intended to utter under each heading, — with a hope
that if any one compact part should be destroyed or injured in its
compactness by treachery of memory, or by the course of the debate,
each other compact part might be there in its entirety, ready for
use; — or at least so many of the compact parts as treachery of
memory and the accidents of the debate might leave to him; so
that his speech might be like a vessel, watertight in its various
compartments, that would float by the buoyancy of its stern and bow,
even though the hold should be waterlogged. But this use of his
composed words, even though he should be able to carry it through,
would not complete his work; — for it would be his duty to answer in
some sort those who had gone before him, and in order to do this he
must be able to insert, without any prearrangement of words or ideas,
little intercalatory parts between those compact masses of argument
with which he had been occupying himself for many laborious hours. As
he looked round upon the House and perceived that everything was dim
before him, that all his original awe of the House had returned, and
with it a present quaking fear that made him feel the pulsations
of his own heart, he became painfully aware that the task he had
prepared for himself was too great. He should, on this the occasion
of his rising to his maiden legs, have either prepared for himself
a short general speech, which could indeed have done little for his
credit in the House, but which might have served to carry off the
novelty of the thing, and have introduced him to the sound of his own
voice within those walls, — or he should have trusted to what his wit
and spirit would produce for him on the spur of the moment, and not
have burdened himself with a huge exercise of memory. During the
presentation of a few petitions he tried to repeat to himself the
first of his compact parts, — a compact part on which, as it might
certainly be brought into use let the debate have gone as it might,
he had expended great care. He had flattered himself that there
was something of real strength in his words as he repeated them to
himself in the comfortable seclusion of his own room, and he had made
them so ready to his tongue that he thought it to be impossible that
he should forget even an intonation. Now he found that he could not
remember the first phrases without unloosing and looking at a small
roll of paper which he held furtively in his hand. What was the good
of looking at it? He would forget it again in the next moment. He had
intended to satisfy the most eager of his friends, and to astound his
opponents. As it was, no one would be satisfied, — and none astounded
but they who had trusted in him.
</p>
<p>
The debate began, and if the leisure afforded by a long and tedious
speech could have served him, he might have had leisure enough. He
tried at first to follow all that this advocate for the ballot might
say, hoping thence to acquire the impetus of strong interest; but he
soon wearied of the work, and began to long that the speech might
be ended, although the period of his own martyrdom would thereby
be brought nearer to him. At half-past seven so many members had
deserted their seats, that Phineas began to think that he might be
saved all further pains by a “count out.” He reckoned the members
present and found that they were below the mystic forty, — first by
two, then by four, by five, by seven, and at one time by eleven.
It was not for him to ask the Speaker to count the House, but he
wondered that no one else should do so. And yet, as the idea of this
termination to the night’s work came upon him, and as he thought of
his lost labour, he almost took courage again, — almost dreaded rather
than wished for the interference of some malicious member. But there
was no malicious member then present, or else it was known that Lords
of the Treasury and Lords of the Admiralty would flock in during
the Speaker’s ponderous counting, — and thus the slow length of the
ballot-lover’s verbosity was permitted to evolve itself without
interruption. At eight o’clock he had completed his catalogue of
illustrations, and immediately Mr. Monk rose from the Treasury bench
to explain the grounds on which the Government must decline to
support the motion before the House.
</p>
<p>
Phineas was aware that Mr. Monk intended to speak, and was aware also
that his speech would be very short. “My idea is,” he had said to
Phineas, “that every man possessed of the franchise should dare to
have and to express a political opinion of his own; that otherwise
the franchise is not worth having; and that men will learn that when
all so dare, no evil can come from such daring. As the ballot would
make any courage of that kind unnecessary, I dislike the ballot. I
shall confine myself to that, and leave the illustration to younger
debaters.” Phineas also had been informed that Mr. Turnbull would
reply to Mr. Monk, with the purpose of crushing Mr. Monk into dust,
and Phineas had prepared his speech with something of an intention of
subsequently crushing Mr. Turnbull. He knew, however, that he could
not command his opportunity. There was the chapter of accidents to
which he must accommodate himself; but such had been his programme
for the evening.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Monk made his speech, — and though he was short, he was very fiery
and energetic. Quick as lightning words of wrath and scorn flew from
him, in which he painted the cowardice, the meanness, the falsehood
of the ballot. “The ballot-box,” he said, “was the grave of all true
political opinion.” Though he spoke hardly for ten minutes, he seemed
to say more than enough, ten times enough, to slaughter the argument
of the former speaker. At every hot word as it fell Phineas was
driven to regret that a paragraph of his own was taken away from him,
and that his choicest morsels of standing ground were being cut from
under his feet. When Mr. Monk sat down, Phineas felt that Mr. Monk
had said all that he, Phineas Finn, had intended to say.
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Turnbull rose slowly from the bench below the gangway. With
a speaker so frequent and so famous as Mr. Turnbull no hurry is
necessary. He is sure to have his opportunity. The Speaker’s eye is
ever travelling to the accustomed spots. Mr. Turnbull rose slowly and
began his oration very mildly. “There was nothing,” he said, “that he
admired so much as the poetic imagery and the high-flown sentiment
of his right honourable friend the member for West Bromwich,” — Mr.
Monk sat for West Bromwich, — “unless it were the stubborn facts and
unanswered arguments of his honourable friend who had brought forward
this motion.” Then Mr. Turnbull proceeded after his fashion to crush
Mr. Monk. He was very prosaic, very clear both in voice and language,
very harsh, and very unscrupulous. He and Mr. Monk had been joined
together in politics for over twenty years; — but one would have
thought, from Mr. Turnbull’s words, that they had been the bitterest
of enemies. Mr. Monk was taunted with his office, taunted with his
desertion of the liberal party, taunted with his ambition, — and
taunted with his lack of ambition. “I once thought,” said Mr.
Turnbull, — “nay, not long ago I thought, that he and I would have
fought this battle for the people, shoulder to shoulder, and knee to
knee; — but he has preferred that the knee next to his own shall wear
a garter, and that the shoulder which supports him shall be decked
with a blue ribbon, — as shoulders, I presume, are decked in those
closet conferences which are called Cabinets.”
</p>
<p>
Just after this, while Mr. Turnbull was still going on with a variety
of illustrations drawn from the United States, Barrington Erle
stepped across the benches up to the place where Phineas was sitting,
and whispered a few words into his ear. “Bonteen is prepared to
answer Turnbull, and wishes to do it. I told him that I thought you
should have the opportunity, if you wish it.” Phineas was not ready
with a reply to Erle at the spur of the moment. “Somebody told
me,” continued Erle, “that you had said that you would like to speak
to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“So I did,” said Phineas.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I tell Bonteen that you will do it?”
</p>
<p>
The chamber seemed to swim round before our hero’s eyes. Mr. Turnbull
was still going on with his clear, loud, unpleasant voice, but there
was no knowing how long he might go on. Upon Phineas, if he should
now consent, might devolve the duty, within ten minutes, within three
minutes, of rising there before a full House to defend his great
friend, Mr. Monk, from a gross personal attack. Was it fit that
such a novice as he should undertake such a work as that? Were he
to do so, all that speech which he had prepared, with its various
self-floating parts, must go for nothing. The task was exactly that
which, of all tasks, he would best like to have accomplished, and
to have accomplished well. But if he should fail! And he felt that
he would fail. For such work a man should have all his senses
about him, — his full courage, perfect confidence, something almost
approaching to contempt for listening opponents, and nothing of fear
in regard to listening friends. He should be as a cock in his own
farmyard, master of all the circumstances around him. But Phineas
Finn had not even as yet heard the sound of his own voice in that
room. At this moment, so confused was he, that he did not know where
sat Mr. Mildmay, and where Mr. Daubeny. All was confused, and there
arose as it were a sound of waters in his ears, and a feeling as of a
great hell around him. “I had rather wait,” he said at last. “Bonteen
had better reply.” Barrington Erle looked into his face, and then
stepping back across the benches, told Mr. Bonteen that the
opportunity was his.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Turnbull continued speaking quite long enough to give poor
Phineas time for repentance; but repentance was of no use. He had
decided against himself, and his decision could not be reversed. He
would have left the House, only it seemed to him that had he done so
every one would look at him. He drew his hat down over his eyes, and
remained in his place, hating Mr. Bonteen, hating Barrington Erle,
hating Mr. Turnbull, — but hating no one so much as he hated himself.
He had disgraced himself for ever and could never recover the
occasion which he had lost.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bonteen’s speech was in no way remarkable. Mr. Monk, he said, had
done the State good service by adding his wisdom and patriotism to
the Cabinet. The sort of argument which Mr. Bonteen used to prove
that a man who has gained credit as a legislator should in process of
time become a member of the executive, is trite and common, and was
not used by Mr. Bonteen with any special force. Mr. Bonteen was glib
of tongue and possessed that familiarity with the place which poor
Phineas had lacked so sorely. There was one moment, however, which
was terrible to Phineas. As soon as Mr. Bonteen had shown the purpose
for which he was on his legs, Mr. Monk looked round at Phineas, as
though in reproach. He had expected that this work should fall into
the hands of one who would perform it with more warmth of heart than
could be expected from Mr. Bonteen. When Mr. Bonteen ceased, two or
three other short speeches were made and members fired off their
little guns. Phineas having lost so great an opportunity, would not
now consent to accept one that should be comparatively valueless.
Then there came a division. The motion was lost by a large
majority, — by any number you might choose to name, as Phineas had
said to Lord Brentford; but in that there was no triumph to the poor
wretch who had failed through fear, and who was now a coward in his
own esteem.
</p>
<p>
He left the House alone, carefully avoiding all speech with any one.
As he came out he had seen Laurence Fitzgibbon in the lobby, but he
had gone on without pausing a moment, so that he might avoid his
friend. And when he was out in Palace Yard, where was he to go next?
He looked at his watch, and found that it was just ten. He did not
dare to go to his club, and it was impossible for him to go home and
to bed. He was very miserable, and nothing would comfort him but
sympathy. Was there any one who would listen to his abuse of himself,
and would then answer him with kindly apologies for his own weakness?
Mrs. Bunce would do it if she knew how, but sympathy from Mrs. Bunce
would hardly avail. There was but one person in the world to whom he
could tell his own humiliation with any hope of comfort, and that
person was Lady Laura Kennedy. Sympathy from any man would have been
distasteful to him. He had thought for a moment of flinging himself
at Mr. Monk’s feet and telling all his weakness; — but he could not
have endured pity even from Mr. Monk. It was not to be endured from
any man.
</p>
<p>
He thought that Lady Laura Kennedy would be at home, and probably
alone. He knew, at any rate, that he might be allowed to knock at her
door, even at that hour. He had left Mr. Kennedy in the House, and
there he would probably remain for the next hour. There was no man
more constant than Mr. Kennedy in seeing the work of the day, — or of
the night, — to its end. So Phineas walked up Victoria Street, and
from thence into Grosvenor Place, and knocked at Lady Laura’s door.
“Yes; Lady Laura was at home; and alone.” He was shown up into the
drawing-room, and there he found Lady Laura waiting for her husband.
</p>
<p>
“So the great debate is over,” she said, with as much of irony as she
knew how to throw into the epithet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; it is over.”
</p>
<p>
“And what have they done, — those leviathans of the people?”
</p>
<p>
Then Phineas told her what was the majority.
</p>
<p>
“Is there anything the matter with you, Mr. Finn?” she said, looking
at him suddenly. “Are you not well?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I am very well.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you not sit down? There is something wrong, I know. What is
it?”
</p>
<p>
“I have simply been the greatest idiot, the greatest coward, the most
awkward ass that ever lived!”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know why I should come to tell you of it at this hour at
night, but I have come that I might tell you. Probably because there
is no one else in the whole world who would not laugh at me.”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate, I shall not laugh at you,” said Lady Laura.
</p>
<p>
“But you will despise me.”
</p>
<p>
“That I am sure I shall not do.”
</p>
<p>
“You cannot help it. I despise myself. For years I have placed before
myself the ambition of speaking in the House of Commons; — for years I
have been thinking whether there would ever come to me an opportunity
of making myself heard in that assembly, which I consider to be
the first in the world. To-day the opportunity has been offered to
me, — and, though the motion was nothing, the opportunity was great.
The subject was one on which I was thoroughly prepared. The manner
in which I was summoned was most flattering to me. I was especially
called on to perform a task which was most congenial to my
feelings; — and I declined because I was afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“You had thought too much about it, my friend,” said Lady Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Too much or too little, what does it matter?” replied Phineas, in
despair. “There is the fact. I could not do it. Do you remember the
story of Conachar in the ‘Fair Maid of Perth;’ — how his heart refused
to give him blood enough to fight? He had been suckled with the milk
of a timid creature, and, though he could die, there was none of the
strength of manhood in him. It is about the same thing with me, I
take it.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think you are at all like Conachar,” said Lady Laura.
</p>
<p>
“I am equally disgraced, and I must perish after the same fashion. I
shall apply for the Chiltern Hundreds in a day or two.”
</p>
<p>
“You will do nothing of the kind,” said Lady Laura, getting up from
her chair and coming towards him. “You shall not leave this room till
you have promised me that you will do nothing of the kind. I do not
know as yet what has occurred to-night; but I do know that that
modesty which has kept you silent is more often a grace than a
disgrace.”
</p>
<p>
This was the kind of sympathy which he wanted, She drew her chair
nearer to him, and then he explained to her as accurately as he could
what had taken place in the House on this evening, — how he had
prepared his speech, how he had felt that his preparation was vain,
how he perceived from the course of the debate that if he spoke
at all his speech must be very different from what he had first
intended; how he had declined to take upon himself a task which
seemed to require so close a knowledge of the ways of the House and
of the temper of the men, as the defence of such a man as Mr. Monk.
In accusing himself he, unconsciously, excused himself, and his
excuse, in Lady Laura’s ears, was more valid than his accusation.
</p>
<p>
“And you would give it all up for that?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I think I ought.”
</p>
<p>
“I have very little doubt but that you were right in allowing Mr.
Bonteen to undertake such a task. I should simply explain to Mr. Monk
that you felt too keen an interest in his welfare to stand up as an
untried member in his defence. It is not, I think, the work for a man
who is not at home in the House. I am sure Mr. Monk will feel this,
and I am quite certain that Mr. Kennedy will think that you have been
right.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not care what Mr. Kennedy may think.”
</p>
<p>
“Why do you say that, Mr. Finn? That is not courteous.”
</p>
<p>
“Simply because I care so much what Mr. Kennedy’s wife may think.
Your opinion is all in all to me, — only that I know you are too kind
to me.”
</p>
<p>
“He would not be too kind to you. He is never too kind to any one. He
is justice itself.”
</p>
<p>
Phineas, as he heard the tones of her voice, could not but feel that
there was in Lady Laura’s words something of an accusation against
her husband.
</p>
<p>
“I hate justice,” said Phineas. “I know that justice would condemn
me. But love and friendship know nothing of justice. The value of
love is that it overlooks faults, and forgives even crimes.”
</p>
<p>
“I, at any rate,” said Lady Laura, “will forgive the crime of your
silence in the House. My strong belief in your success will not be in
the least affected by what you tell me of your failure to-night. You
must await another opportunity; and, if possible, you should be less
anxious as to your own performance. There is Violet.” As Lady Laura
spoke the last words, there was a sound of a carriage stopping in the
street, and the front door was immediately opened. “She is staying
here, but has been dining with her uncle, Admiral Effingham.” Then
Violet Effingham entered the room, rolled up in pretty white furs,
and silk cloaks, and lace shawls. “Here is Mr. Finn, come to tell us
of the debate about the ballot.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care twopence about the ballot,” said Violet, as she put out
her hand to Phineas. “Are we going to have a new iron fleet built?
That’s the question.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir Simeon has come out strong to-night,” said Lady Laura.
</p>
<p>
“There is no political question of any importance except the question
of the iron fleet,” said Violet. “I am quite sure of that, and so, if
Mr. Finn can tell me nothing about the iron fleet, I’ll go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Kennedy will tell you everything when he comes home,” said
Phineas.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Kennedy! Mr. Kennedy never tells one anything. I doubt
whether Mr. Kennedy thinks that any woman knows the meaning of the
British Constitution.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what it means, Violet?” asked Lady Laura.
</p>
<p>
“To be sure I do. It is liberty to growl about the iron fleet, or
the ballot, or the taxes, or the peers, or the bishops, — or anything
else, except the House of Commons. That’s the British Constitution.
Good-night, Mr. Finn.”
</p>
<p>
“What a beautiful creature she is!” said Phineas.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed,” said Lady Laura.
</p>
<p>
“And full of wit and grace and pleasantness. I do not wonder at your
brother’s choice.”
</p>
<p>
It will be remembered that this was said on the day before Lord
Chiltern had made his offer for the third time.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Oswald! he does not know as yet that she is in town.”
</p>
<p>
After that Phineas went, not wishing to await the return of Mr.
Kennedy. He had felt that Violet Effingham had come into the room
just in time to remedy a great difficulty. He did not wish to speak
of his love to a married woman, — to the wife of the man who called
him friend, — to a woman who he felt sure would have rebuked him. But
he could hardly have restrained himself had not Miss Effingham been
there.
</p>
<p>
But as he went home he thought more of Miss Effingham than he did of
Lady Laura; and I think that the voice of Miss Effingham had done
almost as much towards comforting him as had the kindness of the
other.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, he had been comforted.
</p>
