<p>Their mother was dead.</p>

<p>She had lived only thirty years, and a few months; but she had died before her time, as so many do, of over-toil and little food, some days no food at all, only grass seeds and leaves of wild sage. She was dead; a mere skeleton, brown and dry as a mummy, lying on her bed of dry ferns, from which swarms of lice and fleas were hurrying in their knowledge of and horror of a lifeless thing; only the torpid flies remained, gathering together in black dots upon her as the day advanced.</p>

<p>Her two children, who had seen her die, and had exhausted themselves in shrieks and sobs, went up to her again and kissed her and pressed their heads against her body. But there was no warmth, no response.</p>

<p>“She must be dead--dead--dead,” said the elder of them; and then they fell again to weeping, and they screamed loudly and long. But the echoes of their screams were the only answer that they had.</p>

<p>The day was now bright, and the great grass plains were hushed in their morning calm. A little greenfinch was hopping to and fro on a slab of broken marble, pecking at some seed or insect invisible to any eyes except his own; the small bird was the only living thing near.</p>

<p>The woman had come there three years earlier. She had been the wife or leman of a shepherd who had had some share, through his revelations, in the capture of a noted brigand whose headquarters had been at Palombaro. For that share the shepherd had been quieted for ever, by a dagger-stroke between the shoulders, one evening as he took his flocks to drink at the Anio water.</p>

<p>Life in Palombaro was no longer safe or possible for the family known to belong to him. She left the town stealthily and in terror, carrying with her a new-born male child, whilst her two elder children toiled after her as best they could, carrying a few cooking-vessels and a bundle of clothes. She went on and on, on and on, down into the Campagna and across it to the south, resting as she could under thickets or amongst buried tombs, scarcely knowing what she did for the grief which was within her for her murdered love, and the torturing knowledge that he had deserved his end, having been a traitor, or at best a tell-tale: there is no other crime so dark in these parts as to speak of things which are hidden, and to aid the law against an outlaw.</p>

<p>For some time she dared not show herself by daylight, but at last she found a deserted hut built up out of rushes and brackens by the side of some blocks of tufa, once portions of a tomb; and here, finding herself left undisturbed, she ventured to remain with her two elder children; the little male had died of exposure and fevered milk in the earliest days of her flight. In this hut, under the Mons Sacer, she dwelt three years, getting a few coins by gathering the flowers of the plains and taking them to Rome, which was within sight at a few miles’ distance; this she did from the beginning of winter until the beginning of summer; in summer there were no buyers in the city, and there was no one on the plains except a very few, widely scattered, fever-stricken peasants as miserable as herself.</p>

<p>The children, to whom she gave almost all she could get to eat, did not suffer greatly; but she did. From a stout, strong, bright-eyed, red-cheeked woman, she became a mere skeleton, hectic, parched, always thirsty, always racked by a deep-set painful cough and rheumatic pangs. She went into the city, with the flowers which the children gathered, all through a fourth winter; and then in the great heats took to her bed, such as it was, and could do no more; the malarial disease had seized her. It was now the beginning of another winter; and she lay dead on the dead ferns, and the sense of death stole like the cold of the air into the two children, who were now alone on earth.</p>

<p>They were aged now twelve and ten years respectively; they were called Prisca and Petronilla. But for their squalor, their fleshlessness,
and their sunburnt, unwashed skins, they would have been handsome children, and their eyes were large, and, when they were not filled with
tears, glowed like the lamps lit before shrines and tabernacles in old mediæval streets. They had loved their mother with that selfish, unconscious love which is all that good mothers usually receive. She had been their all; she had been like a divinity to them, bringing them
all the nourishment and succour that they ever got. Sometimes they had gone with her into the city, but usually she had left them in the
hut, for the way was long, and the stress in the streets dangerous; and then how they had watched for her as the sun went down behind the great dome, which afar off rose dark on the horizon! How they had run to meet her! How happy they had been when they had seen her returning over the turf in the late evening light—a poor, ragged, dusty, wayworn figure, but
to them so dear, such a harbinger of food, of joy, of safety! For when they were alone they were afraid.</p>

<p>And now they were alone for ever: some vague sense of that immense, irremediable loss, that lifelong solitude, weighed on their ignorance. They had seen their father brought home dead, a dark, red wound gaping between his brown shoulder-blades; but then their mother had remained, they had not been alone. No one would ever come to them now, they knew;
no one ever came there. No one probably even knew that there were human creatures under that wattle cone beneath the tufa ruin. Once they had seen some horses and riders pass within sight, going at full stride over the grass: their mother had told them it was the Roman hunt, and bade them mark the pretty piebald and skewbald-coated hounds plunging amongst the brushwood; but that was all, and was two winters past. She had hidden herself and them with care, and had never lighted a fire of brambles on the floor of the beaten earth, except when night had fallen, and the white
smoke could not be seen.</p>

<p>They mourned and wailed beside her all that day, and all the following night, and, as the sun rose on the second day, Prisca, who was the elder, said to her sister:—</p>

<p>“There is nothing to eat.”</p>

<p>They had finished the one half-loaf of black bread and the remains of cold maize porridge: there was nothing more.</p>

<p>Petronilla only sobbed.</p>

<p>“It is bad not to eat,” said Prisca.</p>

<p>“It is bad,” moaned Petronilla, as she rocked herself to and fro on the floor. She was not intelligent; she was the mere echo of her sister.</p>

<p>“We must go and gather flowers,” said Prisca; but her eyes rested wistfully on the dead body. They could not gather flowers, and go and sell
them, without leaving their dead mother.</p>

<p>Prisca knew enough of death to know that the dead could not be hurt by solitude or neglect; but still she could not bear the thought of leaving
that corpse all by itself in the lonely hut, with the torpid flies creeping at will over it, and the dull grey and black hues of corruption stealing farther and farther upon it. But she was hungry, and Petronilla was more hungry still, and there was nothing in the hut—not a crust, not a crumb.</p>

<p>“We must go,” she said; and she took the osier baskets, and the knives, and gave one of each to her sister. She looked back at their
mother as she lay on the bed of leaves; some idea that she must be put in the earth, somehow, somewhere, crossed her mind, but it was vague, indefinite, she did not pursue the thought. No one would touch the body until they returned, for none knew that the hut was inhabited. No one had ever been there, except those huntsmen; and, sometimes, black against the light, the distant form of a shepherd or a mounted buffalo driver.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said to Petronilla; “if we wait, the sun will fade the flowers.”</p>

<p>It was earliest morning, and cold. The deep rose and crimson of a November sunrise glowed in the south-east. Heavy white dews soaked the grass. Far away on the hills church bells were ringing; they sounded sweet, faint, unearthly.</p>

<p>They noticed none of these things: their eyes were blind with tears as they closed the rickety wooden door of the hut.</p>

<p>“We must make haste,” said Prisca. “It is late.”</p>

<p>“It is late,” said Petronilla.</p>

<p>They knew all the places where flowers dwelt in the greatest numbers. The hut stood amongst thickets of oleanders and cistus, a little stream
ran through it; the hellebores were already plentiful, both black and green; there were still some saffron-coloured dragon’s-mouth, some ox-eyed
daisies, some pale rosy cyclamen along the mossy course of the spring. There were still also many fronds of maiden’s-hair and hart’s tongue. Perhaps the spot had been some great Roman’s garden twenty centuries earlier, for there were some bushes of autumn roses, still in flower, such
roses as Horace gathered and loved.</p>

<p>They selected and cut the blooms with judgment, for they had been taught by their mother to do so, and not to waste or take more than they needed at one time; then they sorted them into little bunches, with a fringe of ferns to each, and tied them up with dry blades of the longest
grass. That done, they arranged them in their baskets, and looked towards Rome.</p>

<p>“It is a long, long way,” said Prisca.</p>

<p>“A long way,” echoed Petronilla; her mouth quivered, her tears rolled down her thin brown cheeks. She was the younger: her mother and Prisca had always spared her as much as was possible, and filled her little stomach if their own had gone empty.</p>

<p>“It is a long way, but we must go,” said Prisca, and she turned and looked wistfully at the hut beyond the oleander and cistus thicket.</p>

<p>Her heart was heavy, and her fears were great. The plain before her looked so wide, the city seemed so far distant. It hurt her, too, so
much to leave that poor corpse there all alone. If a fox or a wild hog should break in and gnaw it? A wolf, too, might come down from the
hills; she had never seen one, but her mother had, once, as she had returned home in a snow-storm.</p>

<p>But there is no help for it, she said to herself; hunger was gnawing her like a hundred wolves, and her mother would have told her to get food for Petronilla before all things; so she set her face towards Rome, taking the child’s hand in hers; their naked feet were blue and half frozen as they trod on the turf so cold and drenched with its frosty dews.</p>

<p>But they had both of them known only hardship from their birth, and were used to the extremes alike of heat and of cold, and every mile they covered brought the sun higher above the mountains, and diminished the pinching chill of the air, although snow was lying deep on the summits of the Sabines.</p>

<p>Once, when they passed by a flock of sheep which was beginning to graze, one of the shepherds, who had left children of his own under the clouds on the breast of Soracte, gave them some skim milk and bread, and let them warm themselves by a fire he had made on a slab of nenfro, from broken boughs and dead reeds and rushes.</p>

<p>“You are taking these weeds into Rome,” he said to them. “You may get into trouble. In the old time we sold anything we chose; anything we found; coins, stones, chips of carvings, skins, whatever we liked. But nowadays,--one of my boys went yonder with a pair of our buffalo horns, and he was taken up for hawking without a licence in the streets. Take care they do not pull you up for your little flowers.”</p>

<p>But Prisca did not understand what he meant.</p>

<p>“Mother always sold them,” she said.</p>

<p>“And where is your mother now?” asked the shepherd.</p>

<p>“She is dead in the hut,” said Prisca.</p>

<p>“Poor soul!” said the shepherd.</p>

<p>They dared not stay long in the pleasant heat from the blazing boughs, for it was already nearly noon. They measured the time by the sun. They went on their way, bolder, and less wretched, now that their hunger was appeased and the air less biting in its cold.</p>

<p>In another hour and a half they had passed the Nomentano bridge, and were at the Porta Pia, where the guards were so busy with the traffic that the children slipped through the bustle and pressure unseen, and entered the city without being questioned.</p>

<p>They had not been there very often with their mother, not often enough to know the streets well; and the rush of the pedallists and the automobilists, the whizz and shriek of the electric trams, the shouts of the vendors of newspapers and programmes, the many vile, earsplitting sounds which rage in every city, where the bark of a dog or the shout of children at play is thought terrible, frightened them, for they had no longer their mother’s skirt to cling to, and their mother’s voice to reassure them with its smiling chiding of their cowardice. <i> “ Vieni vieni! C’e niente!” </i> </p>

<p>“She would never speak any more!” thought Prisca; and she saw the colours and movement of the streets through heavy tears, ever renewing
as she brushed them from her lashes.</p>

<p>She would never speak any more. Oh, cruel problem of arrested life, too hard for such young scholars, too brutal for even those who are aged in life’s study!</p>

<p>They had entered Rome by the Porta Pia, walking onward by instinct rather than by sight. They had passed through the modern quarter of Macao, with its wretched imitations of. South Kensington and Bayswater, and had wandered towards the centre of the city and the Corso. The sky was cloudy; there was fog, due to the factories and railways, in the city, and an icy, drizzling rain had fallen an hour earlier, so that the granite flags were moist and muddy, and horses slipped and fell under men’s lashes and curses.</p>

<p>They were two poor little tatterdemalions with their petticoats up to their knees, and their thick auburn hair curling rough and tangled over their shoulders, and their bare, wet feet, growing colder on the stones of the pavement than on the frosty grass of the Campagna. But they were not conscious of their own unlikeness to the people around them; they had been too used to misery to feel any strangeness in it. Nor did the city daunt them in any way; their minds were too empty for comparison, too innocent for envy. The noise alone intimidated and bewildered them; at their hut, under the tufa blocks and the oleander shrubs, there had been
no noise, except the ripple of the water spring, and the cries of birds and of field-mice.</p>

<p>Petronilla wanted to look at the wonderful shops, so full of glitter and riches; she had already forgotten her mother; she was still sorely
frightened; but the magical colour and glitter of the long, narrow, rich, thronged street fascinated her.</p>

<p> <i>“O bellow!”</i> she murmured at every step, <i>“O bello!”</i> </p>

<p>Prisca dragged her angrily onward.</p>

<p>“We shall never get back to-night,” she said in anguish, for to leave her mother alone all the night was more appalling to her than were any
terrors or needs for herself.</p>

<p>As yet they had sold nothing; had not even had the courage to arrest and accost even one of these people so different to themselves, so wholly unlike the poor shepherds and peasants, who were all they had ever seen. Their mother had always stopped, and lifted up her basket, and said some imploring words whenever she had seen a person who had a kind face, or a carriage with children in it, stopping before a shop door. But, without her, Prisca felt as if she should never have the courage to ask for a <i>centième; </i> the great rush and babble and pressure of the long street bewildered her. Yet, if they sold nothing, what use was it to have come
there? What would they have to take back with them to keep them for a few days?</p>

<p>She, who was sensible of the danger in which they now were, of dying of hunger, pressed Petronilla close to her, clutching the child’s arm, and
dragged her towards a shop filled with flowers, such flowers as she had never seen; orchids, scarlet and gold and white, roses of every hue and size, snowy sceptres of tube-roses, and all the forced blossoms of hot-house and palm-house, with lotus and lilies, and small fountains playing over beds of moss.</p>

<p>“Would you buy them?” she said, timidly, and she uncovered her basket.</p>

<p>One of the men in the shop pushed her out onto the pavement.</p>

<p>“Do not come here with your dead weeds, dirtying and dripping on our floor,” he said, angrily. What were the humble, wild things to him, either the children or the flowers?</p>

<p>Were the wild-flowers dead? wondered Prisca: she looked at them in fear. They were faded, for the sun had been strong on the Campagna, and here in the streets it was cold and dark, and she had forgotten to cover them. The grief on her face as she saw this and stumbled out from the florist’s doorway, was so extreme and pitiful that a lady, descending from a carriage, was touched by it.</p>

<p>“Poor little girls!” she said softly, and she opened her purse and gave Prisca a franc, and then entered the flower-shop without looking
longer at them. The eyes of both the children glowed with wonder and rapture; they knew the worth of money from its appearance, and a franc
to them was wealth!</p>

<p>“Begging?” said a rough voice in their rear, and a hard hand clutched hold of Prisca’s shoulder, whilst the fingers of another hand snatched the
little paper note. Two communal guards were passing down the Corso.</p>

<p>“I did not beg, she gave it me!” screamed Prisca; and instinctively she clasped her sister in her arms, and the basket rolled down on the
pavement.</p>

<p>“You have no licence!” said the guard, holding her tight. They did not even know what he meant.</p>

<p>“Take them to the Questura,” said the elder guard. “They are little filthy brats. I saw them yesterday on the Pincio, importuning strangers.”</p>

<p>“Mother died yesterday!” shrieked Prisca. “We were with her. Give me the money. I will go back--”</p>

<p>But the guards did not even listen to her, and the lady, who might perhaps have interfered and rescued them, did not notice the scene; she was busied in ordering the floral decorations for a ball which she was about to give. Several persons passing at the time saw, and were sorry, as they felt when they saw a dog snared by the dog Snatchers, but no one of them dared to intervene; to stop the police in their holy missions is apt to bring the rash and meddlesome citizen who does so into equal misery with those he pities.</p>

<p>Their capture was the work of a moment, and their hands were tied, and their helpless bodies were pushed and kicked into a bye-street.</p>

<p>“Mother! mother! mother!” they screamed together, as though the poor discoloured body lying on its bed of leaves could hear and rise.</p>

<p>An aged priest, with white hair and a thin, frayed cassock, coming out of a doorway, asked shyly and with hesitation what they had done.</p>

<p>“Begging, and annoying carriage people,” said their Captor, shortly and sullenly.</p>

<p>“They are very young and very poor,” said the old priest wistfully.</p>

<p>“Your reverence had better not get into trouble,” said the guard with significance, and he pushed the children on before him. “The streets must be cleared of these vermin,” he added, arrogantly. “Our orders are positive.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he struck the children on their shoulders with the flat of his scabbard, partly to show his contempt for the Church, partly to show
the public the omnipotence of the police. The blows resounded harshly on their fleshless bones, and their screams woke the echoes of the bye
street; but, although various faces showed themselves at the windows and doors of the poor houses of the alley, no one ventured openly to resist.</p>

<p>Ever and again a municipal guard is found, stabbed to the heart in a deserted lane; a carabineer is discovered, shot dead in a wood or a park; or the drowned body of one of the Questura is seen amongst the osiers of a swollen river, which has thrown it up with other flotsam and jetsam after an autumn or winter storm. That is the only vengeance open to the people for a lifelong tyranny. Is the blame theirs if they take it?</p>

<p>Prisca and Petronilla, under the grip of the guard’s hand, and the dread of his scabbard’s blows, stumbled along blindly, holding their breath, ceasing their shrieks, knowing no more whither they went, or what would be their fate, than a poor puppy knows of his destiny when he is
hauled along by a cord round his neck. Rain began to fall, and wetted their uncovered heads, and made their ragged clothing cling to them damp and cold. The guard swore at them because the rain-drops soaked through his collar and tickled his throat, and he pushed them onward in greater
haste until they reached the police-station; and there, without more explanation or any compassion, they were thrown into the lock-up where such offenders are consigned: harmless old vagrants, and young children, pell-mell with thieves and felons of all kinds, cast down much as the dust of the streets is shot by scavengers onto a refuse heap.</p>

<p>They were wet through, and trembled from head to foot, but they were dumb from sheer terror; no one noticed them; they were left in a corner on the flags, fierce, unknown faces, and haggard, repulsive figures around them.</p>

<p>Petronilla crept into her sister’s arms, and thus, with their hair tangled together, and their heads against the wall, they remained, scarcely daring to breathe, never daring to speak, even to one another.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Prisca, so far as she thought at all, were of the dead body lying all alone in the hut.</p>

<p>Petronilla could not think at all; her senses were all stupefied with fear. She clung to her elder by instinct alone: Prisca had always put her first, and saved her from all harm.</p>

<p>They were left in their corner undisturbed, but unsuccoured. There were many sounds around them, and from the corridor behind the cell; tramp of feet, clink of handcuffs, loud voices which commanded, stifled voices which cursed and protested; noises, too, from the street without, of traffic and cries, and now and then the shriek of a dog being lassoed, or the crash of a horse falling on the stones.</p>

<p>At various times the guards entered; one by one, most of those arrested were led out; the day passed; the night fell. There was no light except a glimmer from a gas-jet in the passage beyond, which came through a square, unglazed grating into the cell. Three persons alone remained there beside the children: one a very old woman taken up for begging, the second a youth who had been hawking wares without a licence, and the third a pickpocket. The old woman told her beads and muttered over them incessantly; the youth sobbed and swore, and cursed the parents who had
given him birth, and the hawker who had tricked him into buying the wares; the pickpocket swore himself off to sleep, being familiar with his situation, and knowing that either resistance or repining was useless. No one spoke to the children, who, indeed, looked no more than a bundle of rags huddled up in their dark corner.</p>

<p>Once the youth got up and awakened the pickpocket, arousing a volley of dreadful oaths.</p>

<p>“Shall we be here all night?” he asked tremulously.</p>

<p>“Certain sure,” said the thief.</p>

<p>“With nothing to eat?”</p>

<p>The thief turned on his side, and resumed his slumbers, not answering so foolish a question.</p>

<p>Prisca, whose ears had caught the word “eat,” listened where she lay in the torpor of her terror; if only she could get some bread for her sister! But when silence alone answered the youth’s question, she understood. There was no hope of any food that night.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, dear mother!” she wailed aloud. She could not believe that their mother could be deaf to their prayers. Her body was dead and cold--yes--but <i>she</i> must be somewhere.</p>

<p>The old woman looked towards the corner where the children lay and stopped her aves for a moment; then shook her head and went on again, telling her beads. She had enough to do to think of herself. She had a sick son, and seven grandchildren, at home in her cellar; they were all waiting for her, and for what they would expect her to take home to them. She could not busy her brains with others, though a meagre pang of fellow feeling ran through her slow veins for a moment. If she had had anything to give the children in the corner, yonder, she would have given it, but she had nothing.</p>

<p>The night grew darker; at times a key grated in the lock, and the bolts were pushed back, and guards entered, again and again, and held up
over them a petroleum lamp to make sure that those detained were there. Their visit made, they withdrew, leaving the blackness of night behind
them. There was not even a glimmer of the gas-jet in the corridor, for that light had been put out early.</p>

<p>As the hours went on the youth sobbed him self to sleep, the pickpocket snored, the old woman ceased to mutter her prayers, and fell asleep with her head upon her breast; the children could not sleep; their clothes had dried on them, stiff and miserable; their bones ached in every joint; fever had come upon them, with its chills, its heats, its
tremors, its aching throats; they thought they were only hungry and unhappy, but they were very ill. The time passed for them in a dull, stupid suffering, varied by paroxysms in which they screamed aloud. In one of these the pickpocket flung one of his boots at them, with a curse, through the dark, and then the other. The latter struck Prisca on the head. The old woman, awaking dimly to what was passing, thought she was at
home in her cellar: “Don’t hit the babes, Beppo,” she murmured drowsily, believing that she spoke to her son.</p>

<p>“I will slit their pipes if they are not quiet,” said the thief.</p>

<p>He forgot that his knife had been taken away from him on his entrance there. Prisca, however, understood the sense of his threat, as she leaned against the wall, and her heavy eyes dilated, and she drew her little sister still closer to her with a maternal gesture of protection. She did not let herself sleep again, and she succeeded in hushing Petronilla into unconsciousness and rest. So the black night wore away.</p>

<p>In the grey, dull light which came with morning from the corridor, the filthy figure of the old woman, huddled in her rags, the stupid, scared face of the youth, the brutalised countenance and stinking clothes of the thief, the dirty floor of the cell, and its bare, walls, gained a still more hideous aspect. Neither of the children dared look up: they cowered down one against the other, hiding their eyes; they still believed that in some way or another their mother would arise and come to their aid. One by one the guards took out the three others, and no one of them returned. The door was locked and bolted; the window strongly grated; vague ideas of escape crossed Prisca’s mind, indistinctly stirring under the lethargy of her fear and stupor. But she had consciousness enough left to see that it would be impossible.</p>

<p>“They will forget us, and we shall die,” she thought; it did not seem to matter. If only the gaolers would give her sister something to eat!</p>

<p>Petronilla was always murmuring: “Mother, mother! Where is the bread?” For their mother, going without often herself, had always given them
a good hunch of bread on their awaking.</p>

<p>It was late in the forenoon when those who had come for the others came for them.</p>

<p>“Get up!” said the guard, and he pushed them with his foot.</p>

<p>Prisca, trembling, tried to obey, but her body and limbs felt stiff as stakes, and yet empty.</p>

<p>Petronilla continued to cry, “Mother--bread!” as a hungry fledgeling in a deserted nest cries for his slain parents, and his lost food, whilst the bird-slaughterers stride on, indifferent, through the grass and the blossoms of spring.</p>

<p>The man pulled them both up from the floor with rude hands.</p>

<p>“Go on, or it will be bad for you,” he said; “there is no use in shamming here.”</p>

<p>Prisca tried to obey, for she had sense enough to know that they would only fare worse the more they resisted. Her feet were numbed, and her sinews seemed frozen, but she managed to lift up Petronilla, and, half dragging and half carrying her, went out of the cell before the guard, who held their hair, to keep close hold on them, and every now and then gave it a rough jerk, as a bad driver tugs at a curb.</p>

<p>They were taken before the police authorities to receive warrant and order for their consignment to prison. The provisional preliminary imprisonment punishes equally with the guilty those innocent who on their trial are set free. The Commissary of police had, without investigation,
consigned the other three to gaol on the unattested declaration of the guards, the old woman being sentenced because she could not pay a fine.</p>

<p>When the two children were brought before him, the Commissary looked at them with a vague pity: they were two such miserable atoms to be offenders against the law. But he listened to the deposition of the guards, who declared that they had seen these two little vagrants annoying people on the pavement and in carriages, and had also seen them beg for and obtain money. When asked their names and residence, they had been obstinately mute; they had been taken up at three o’clock in the previous afternoon; they were old and incorrigible offenders, well known to the police for their contumacy: so at least said their accusers.</p>

<p>“They are very young,” said the Commissary, “but if they be contumacious--</p>

<p>Then he questioned them.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“In the hut,” said Prisca, feebly.</p>

<p>“Where is your mother?”</p>

<p>“In the hut.”</p>

<p>“Where is this hut?”</p>

<p>Prisca did not answer; she did not know.</p>

<p>“Your names and ages?” he continued.</p>

<p>Prisca did not reply.</p>

<p>“Find the mother,” said the Commissary to the guard; “she is more to blame than they.”</p>

<p>“Where is your mother?” said the guard, and shook Prisca by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Dead--dead,” said the child.</p>

<p>“But if she be in the hut?”</p>

<p>“She is in the hut.”</p>

<p>“And where is that?”</p>

<p>Prisca made a vague gesture which implied immeasurable distance.</p>

<p>“They are imbecile,” said the Commissary, “or they are feigning idiocy. They are very small, very miserable. Send them out of the city. They come, it is plain to see, from the Campagna.”</p>

<p>There were scores of similar children in the prisons and penitentiaries since the recent laws against vagrancy had been set in motion. He felt unwilling to add these miserable little creatures to the number.</p>

<p></p> <!-- extra space between paragraphs in the original. -->

<p>“You may go,” he said to them; “I will not send you before the tribunal this time. But if you be found again in Rome no mercy will be
shown you.”</p>

<p></p> <!-- extra space between paragraphs in the original. -->

<p>“He lacks zeal,” thought a brigadier standing behind his chair, and he meditated a secret report against his too supine chief.</p>

<p></p> <!-- extra space between paragraphs in the original. -->

“Take them away. Put them in the street,” said that gentleman with impatience; he felt sorry for these little, lonely, stupid waifs, and he dared not show it for fear of the argus-eyed officials and underlings around him; he would have given them some small coins, but he dared not
encourage mendicancy with all these chartered spies around him.</p>

<p>The children were pushed outside the room, down several passages, and finally thrust through the entrance doorway into the open air. There the guard gave each a shake and a slap.</p>

<p>“Get out of the city, little beasts, and keep out of it,” he said, as his valediction.</p>

<p>Prisca understood that they were free. Petronilla understood nothing, except that she ached all over, and wanted to eat and drink. It was
twenty-four hours since they had received the charity of the shepherd on the plains.</p>

<p>Prisca did not know where she was: there were the babble, the bustle, the noise of the streets around her, and she did not know when, or where, these stony ways and long lines of walls would cease. Her little sister was like a log to drag along; the child scarcely moved, scarcely aided herself in any way, and Prisca felt her own limbs quivering under her, and the chills and heats of fever coursing turn by turn through her veins.</p>

<p>They had come in by a gate, by a barrier, they must go out by one: that was all which was clear to her; that the gates and barriers might lead to totally different points of the compass was wholly beyond the grasp of her mind in its actual state.</p>

<p>Now, she had entered by the Porta Pia; but the Questura, from which she had been expelled, was in the Via di Arancio, to the west of the Corso, and it was into an alley out of this street that they were turned adrift, knowing less than a lost dog where to turn or what to do. But haunted by the command which had sunk into her dulled brain to get out of
the city at once, or be hauled back to prison, Prisca, trembling in every limb, ventured to stop by an old man selling chestnuts, and to under her breath, “The gate! Where is the gate?”</p>

<p>“What gate?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The gate!” she repeated.</p>

<p>He pointed upward towards the left.</p>

<p>“The Porta del Popolo is yonder. Is that the one you want? Or is it the Salara?” said the old man, who was patient and kind.</p>

<p>“No,” said Prisca; then, searching in her aching, puzzled brain, she added, “ours is Por’ Pia.”</p>

<p>“That lies the other way. You must go towards the Quirinal,” said the chestnut seller, and patiently pointed out where they should go; and then, neglecting his smoking stove, seeing Prisca’s face so wan and blue and scared, he offered her a handful of his chestnuts. “For nothing, for nothing; take them, little ones,” he said good-naturedly.</p>

<p>But she dared not take them; the terror of another accusation and another arrest was on her. She dragged her sister away from the stall, and went on up the street, the child screaming and resisting. He had explained to her the across the maze of streets to Porta Pia, clearly enough for anyone who had known anything of Rome to find the way. But Prisca only gathered a confused sense of some vast wilderness stretching between her and the homeward road.</p>

<p>The distance is not very great from the Corso to the Porta Pia to those who are driving in carriages or walking gaily along on pleasant errands. But she could not disentangle the network of the streets, and she went instead, without knowing what she did, towards the Tiber;
taking, by instinct, secluded and silent ways instead of the thoroughfares, where the traffic bewildered her more and more. She was footsore and fever-stricken, and the child hung on her like a leaden weight. Her sole means of making a few pence had been taken from her, and the lady’s gift also. In her dull, aching brain a sense of the injustice done to her seemed to burn her like a fire.</p>

<p>What a quantity of bread that lira would have bought! Why had the guard kept it? Petronilla was crying and moaning with hunger. She herself could not have eaten if all the shops and inns of Rome had been open to her; but Petronilla!—Prisca felt as if she sinned against her mother, sinned against the Madonna, in letting the child want.</p>

<p>She dragged her frozen feet along over the stones in a belief that she was going towards Porta Pia and the open country, but in reality she had turned away from it; she often went over the same ground again and again, in circles, like a child lost in forest, and she was always farther and farther from her goal. At last she came on a wholly deserted street: one of those marked for demolition. The dwellers in had been turned out, the houses were shut up; there was even church which was closed, as it was to be swept away in few weeks. It had a noble doorway rising above some wide, low steps; the portico and pillars were of travertine marble; the sculptured Ecce Homo above it was of fine fifteenth-century work; a dealer in such things had already bought it for a foreign patron; the door itself was of oak, finely carved in panels which represented the life of St. Jerome, to whom the church was dedicated.</p>

<p>Prisca saw its broad, smooth, easy steps at the moment when Petronilla sank out of her grasp onto the stones, and she herself felt that she could move no more. With one last effort she carried her sister onto the steps, and dragged her upward until they each leaned against the door. The portico sheltered them in a measure from the blasts of a keen wind blowing from the north, which drove down the doomed street clouds of grey dust from portions of it already dismantled.</p>

<p>No one came thither. The workmen were making holiday, for it was the vigil of the Presentation of the Virgin; now and then the wind shook a loose shutter, or dislodged some loosened bricks; nothing else moved. A sleep, which was mere stupor, stole over Prisca; she thought her sister already slept, for the child s head grew heavier and heavier upon her breast. The hours passed; no one came there; delirious fancies passed across Prisca’s mind. She saw her mother and the Madonna, hand in hand, come through the oleander shrubs beside the hut; but they frowned on her and said, “Hast thou let the child starve?”</p>

<p>Then she cried out aloud, and tried to lift up Petronilla’s head, but she could not; it was heavy as a stone.</p>

<p>Then she ceased to dream, and ceased to feel; her eyelids shut out the day, her breath was feeble and fluttering like a half-frozen bird; her last act was to draw her little sister’s curls about her own throat.</p>

<p>“Mother—mother will know,” she thought; and then she, too, was still, like the child upon her knees.</p>

<p>They remained there all the day, and all the night, locked in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>In the morning some scavengers found them, sitting thus. They had been dead many hours.</p>

<p>They were taken to the mortuary house, and thence, none recognising them, they were carried to the common ditch in which the poor and nameless lie.</p>

<p>What were they more than the dust of the street, blown about a little while by the winds, and then swept away and forgotten?</p>
