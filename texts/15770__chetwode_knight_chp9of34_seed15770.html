<!--CHAPTER IX. AMONG THE OUTLAWS.-->

<p>It has ever been my misfortune to sleep too soundly. I can keep watch with any man, but to sleep with one eye open, broad awake at the slightest alarm, as some do, I can not, and more than
once has my heaviness brought me into trouble. It was so now; and even the little maid, over wearyfrom her exertions of the previous night, was caught napping.</p>

<p>The sun had been high in the sky when I lay down. It was sinking fast when I was rudely roused by rough hands laid upon me. I had vowed I would never be taken alive, where were my brave
words now? My foes had stolen upon me while I slept, I was seized and bound before I had timeto defend myself. My struggles availed nothing, it was too late; for the second time I was tied hand
and foot, a helpless prisoner. Happily, the Wolf was not one of my captors. Hearkening to Jocellus, he had made toward Infylde, sending forward his followers to beat every strip of country on
the way. Had this been all, we should have escaped; but to make quite sure he dispatched also four of his band—well-armed outlanders—by the road we had really gone, to see if they could learn aught of us. This I found by their talk afterward, and also how some meddling bondman had told of our entering the wood, where they had traced us step by step.</p>

<p>The scuffle over, my first thought was for Ela, who, to my joy, had not shown herself, nor made the slightest sound. She was so hid that unless they searched well they were not likely to find her. My chief dread was lest she should come forth to
share my captivity. So I cried aloud, as if addressing the men:</p>

<p>“I have a message for one Walter of London; if any man here will carry him word of what has befallen me, great will be his reward.”</p>

<p>A loud laugh went round at my supposed simplicity.</p>

<p>“Call again, my lord, call again,” jeered one. “The birds will hear you, I doubt not. There be none else to carry your message; we put not our necks into the halter.”</p>

<p>” Walter of London, who dwells in Chepe,” I cried yet once more. ” Bid him warn my brother of what has chanced to me.”</p>

<p>” Hold your peace, fool,” said another, striking me on the mouth so that the blood flowed. “Spare your breath to plead with Ranulf; there is none here to do your bidding.”</p>

<p>But I was content. I had seen the bush move as if the wind stirred it; the little maid guessed well my meaning. If naught chanced to her on the way, she would find a friend in the merchant. As to myself, there was small doubt but I should be past help long before she could reach him.</p>

<p>After this, they untied my legs and bid me march, but as we were about to mount the bank, one cried, suddenly: “Stay, was there not another? Did they not speak of some dancing-maid?” He
twisted the rope about my arms till it grew a torture. ” What has come of the woman, sirrah? Where hast thou hidden her? “</p>

<p>“There is no woman here,” I answered stoutly; and that was truth, as I deemed it, taking Ela but for a child. “You came upon me by stealth, as you know. I had no time to hide.”</p>

<p>“Come along, and stay your prating,” shouted the one who seemed their chief. ” What matters the woman to us; it is the man my lord is after. Leave her to the wolves if she is here; we want
her not. Come, it is dark beneath the trees even now. If we linger, we shall miss the way.”</p>

<p>There was no more delay after that. They climbed the bank quickly, pricking me with their knives when I stumbled, and pushed on as fast as possible, taking in their haste the wrong path. I saw it well enough, but I said no word ; it mattered
not to me where they went, though I was glad to be gone. I
could not lose the fear of Ela coming forward, for I knew
it would be a sore trial to see me go from her. We walked on, and
it was plain they knew not much of woodcraft, or they would have seen we were going ever deeper into the heart of the forest. They had come upon a faintly-trodden track, trampled down by men or beasts, and were bent on following it. The head man swore
lustily it would lead them out of the wood.</p>

<p>“See you now, the forest grows less dense,” he cried. ” Were it not so dark we should see the edge of it.”</p>

<p>The trees grew fewer indeed; but it was because we were nearing a space of bog, and, as the ground turned soft beneath our feet, we plunged deeper at every step. It became plain, even to them, that they had lost their way, and there was hot dispute,
each accusing the other of being in fault. When they had had their quarrel out, and struggled back to dry ground, they agreed to halt until the moon rose to guide their steps. The night was chill, and presently they began gathering wood to light a fire,
though one muttered uneasily about bringing the outlaws down upon them. But the others, chafed in temper already, laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>” Here are four of us,” cried the leader. ” We be stout men, well armed, and not a crown, I warrant, among the lot of us. If it were some fat burgher now, or Saxon yeoman trotting home from
market, I would not answer for it ; but the cowardly swine know better than to meddle with sturdy men.” And he heaped on the wood till the flames blazed merrily.</p>

<p>They had made me fast to a tree as soon as they halted, so that I was separated from them some small space where they sat round the fire. Thus I became aware of a low rustling among the
bushes, which they heard not, though at first I gave little heed to it. Some wolf, most likely, prowling round, I thought to myself; or a boar, maybe, roused from its lair, seeking to escape unseen. Then presently it came again nearer still, close almost to my elbow, as if to attack me. I liked not the thought of being mangled, and was on the point of shouting, to alarm them, when an arrow whizzed so close past my ear that I felt the wind of it. It pierced the breast of him who had been feared of the outlaws, striking him with so true an aim that the head came out at his back, and he fell dead without a groan. His comrades jumped to
their feet; but the flames played upon them, whilst their assailants were unseen, and two more fell the next moment, never to rise again. There was but one left now, and he made a desperate rush for the trees; then something bounded out upon him.
I could scarce tell in the dusk whether it were man or beast, until I saw a flash of steel, and he was still.</p>

<p>All this had taken place so swiftly that I had scarce time to draw a breath. As I stood expecting my turn to come next, I felt soft hands about my limbs, and lo! there was the little maid hacking away at my bonds, and striving her utmost to undo them.</p>

<p>“What, Ela, are these your friends?” I cried in amazement, hardly sure I was not dreaming.</p>

<p>“I know not yet whether they be friends or foes,” she returned breathlessly. “I would you were free, a knife in your hands, to confront them.”</p>

<p>Fortunately her fears proved groundless. There were three men in the glade now, wild-looking fellows clad in skins with the hair still on. Rough, tangled beards nearly hid their faces; and
long shaggy locks matted close together formed their only headgear. It is little wonder I doubted at first what they might be. Each wore a long bow in his hand, and a sheaf of arrows at belt, besides a sharp hunting-knife cased in skin. But they spoke
me fair, and one of them, with a stroke of his keen blade, severed the bonds that had baffled Ela.</p>

<p>“It is he I told you of,” cried the little maid, ere I could speak, placing herself between us as if to protect me. ” My brother, who flies from Ranulf the Wolf.”</p>

<p>The outlaw looked at me keenly. My condition was rude and unkempt enough even for him, and he nodded in kindly fashion. ”
Join with us,” he said. “It is a fair life in the wild woods, where no lords come to trouble us.” Then he turned aside to where his companions were stripping the dead men, not to lose his share of the spoil.</p>

<p>“How found you these new friends?” I asked Ela in low tones, chafing my numbed arms.</p>

<p>“It was they who found me, good brother, as I was weeping in the wood alone. I was asleep—fie on me—when the outlanders came; they jumped out so suddenly that you were in their hands before I knew. I was coming out to bid them take me also, when you cried for one to carry your message to Walter. I knew that you were speaking to me, and I kept close, thinking it would help you most to do your bidding. Yet after you were gone I was so feared ill would come to you before I could get word to him, that I wept as I went, and it was then these wild men found me. I told them all, just as it had chanced, save that you were a Norman noble. I said not a word of that, Alain; it would not be wise; they think we are Saxon bond-men like themselves.”</p>

<p>” And so they came to rescue me. How can I thank them?”</p>

<p>” No need to trouble,” rejoined Ela coolly. “Little thought had they of you when their steps turned this way. This is the road to their home, wherever that may be, whither they were compelling me by force. I prayed to be let go, that I might give tidings to one who was your friend. They paid no heed to my tears but made me come with them. We walked for long, until my heart
began to sink within me, for fear I should never find the way back. Then all at once they stopped short in alarm. Strangers had travelled along their path, and they made sure their retreat was discovered. It was I who spied the fire. They were frightened at first; but when I said it might perchance be your captors wandered from the way, they were ready to jump for joy. They crept softly until they were quite close, and the rest you know.”</p>

<p>The spearmen by this time had been stripped to the skin and dragged a short distance away. Then the wild outlaws gathered around where we stood, looking at us curiously. There were but the three of them in all, and he who had cut my bonds—he
was the eldest, his beard almost white—said to me: ” Will you live in the greenwood and be one of us, or will you go your way? “</p>

<p>“If I am free to choose,” I answered quickly, “I would fain go on my way. I have friends who will aid me can I but reach London town.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of the place,” he answered kindly. “It is where the chapmen go; but you will find no fair forest there to hide you in. You may go an you list, we hold no man against his will; but first must you take oath not to betray us: you have
come too near our borders.”</p>

<p>“That will I gladly, seeing that but for you and your arrows I had been prisoner still.”</p>

<p>“Stretch forth your arm, then.” And with the point of his knife he pierced a vein in my arm and his own, making me catch the blood in my right palm. When it was mingled to his fancy, he bade me hold my stained hand aloft in the light of the rising moon, whilst I repeated certain words after him. I mind not now what they were; but they so savoured of heathen incantations not fit for a Christian man, that I muttered a prayer in secret
and made sign of the holy cross when he had done.</p>

<p>“If you betray us now,” he said, “foul fiends will come on the third night at this hour, and tear you limb from limb. Never was a man known to escape them. Best join us after all; we are not
so many but there is room for another, and yours is a stout arm. The maid too has sense; we will find a mate for her.”</p>

<p>But when he saw my mind was set on going, he did not further try to stay me, save by showing that he thought me a craven. In spite of this he did us a great service, offering to guide us out of the forest as far as it was safe for him to go. We thanked him with all our hearts, and when presently the two others, laden with the spoils of the dead men, and the produce of their hunt, passed on into the darkness, the old man stayed with us. ” Wait,”
he said, “until the moon tops yonder beech; then will I guide you straight as an arrow flies. Meantime we will eat.”</p>

<p>Loosing a great hare he carried at his belt, he thrust it just as it was into the embers. Whilst waiting, he told us of the refuge whither he would have taken us if we had joined his band. There was a great bog hard by, not to be traversed save by those who knew the stepping-places ; and in the midst was a little islet of firm ground, whereon they had made their camp.</p>

<p>” We have women there and children too,” he went on. “Your sister would have had company. One brought his wife thither, and I found mine after. They were willing enough to share our fortunes. We hunger not, the woods are full of fresh meat, neither can we thirst while a brook flows. Best of all, we have escaped our lord, and have no tyrant to oppress us.”</p>

<p>“Yet did they lay hands upon you, short would be your shrift,” I said.</p>

<p>” What matters? A man can die but once. Better a rope on the nearest tree and have done with it, than lie in dungeon to be tortured at my lord’s pleasure. I have tried it and I know.” He showed me deep scars upon his shoulders where he had been branded. ” While we live here, our lives are our own. At sign of danger we keep close, and there is only one way they can reach us. They might set fire to the rushes and smoke us out. It
was thought of that frightened us when we saw your fire just now. But as yet you are the first who has come so near to us. If we have made the path too plain, we must seek another. Yet all
is safe so far”; and he rubbed his hands with glee. “You are sworn, and dead men tell no tales. The wolves will feast this night.”</p>

<p>He drew forth the half-cooked hare and, scraping off the ashes and the fur together, divided it into three portions. It suited not the little maid (her dry crusts pleased her better), so we ate her share between us, and then started on our journey. At dawn our good guide left us. He came even to the outskirts of the wood, showing where we could pick up the pack-horse track farther on. And now, having come so far—for crossing the forest
had saved many a long mile where the track woundaround — I had no fear about travelling by day. So we kept on our road until near noon, when we turned aside, and, crossing a meadow foot-deep in lush grass and yellow blossoms the little maid gathered to deck her with, sat down on the banks of a wide river to rest awhile.</p>
