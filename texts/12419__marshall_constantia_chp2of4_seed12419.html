<p>‘ We crown the unconscious brow with wreath of bays, <br>
We press in pulseless hands the sweetest flowers, <br>
When all unheeded any grace of ours.s, <br>
We find a voice for all the loving praises, <br>
For which, perhaps, through weary, unblest dayss, <br>
The heart had hungered. We are slow to proves, <br>
The tenderness we feel, till some dark days, <br>
We can do nought but bow our heads and prays, <br>
That Heaven may teach us how to show our love.s, <br>
May it not be that on the other sides, <br>
They wait for us, and, like us, long to makes, <br>
The sad wrong right, ready to give and takes, <br>
The hand-clasps, and the kisses here denied ?’</p>

<p>After a storm of excitement a calm generally follows. By degrees the strange new thing which has startled us and stirred our souls to their inmost deeps becomes familiar. The sharp edge of grief loses its first keenness ; a great joy subsides into a quiet sense of happiness. We cannot always live at high-pressure ; and as the distance widens between us, and the hour when we were suddenly shaken out of the groove of ordinary daily life, we lose the first bitterness or the first sweetness, as the case may be.</p>

<p>A merciful provision this, springing from the Eternal Love which ordereth all things to meet our needs. It is well for us to realize this, especially when in the first moments of some great sorrow we can look neither beyond nor above it. It shadows us and surrounds us ; <i>it</i> is everything ; the rest nothing. But it too will pass, and as it passes, impossible as it often seems, leaves a blessing behind it.</p>

<p>Silence fell over that interview between me and Mr. Hinchcliffe in the library. He came and went as before ; he brought books and music, and he talked in the old familiar way, as if nothing of importance had ever passed between him and me.</p>

<p>‘ Sometimes I think,’ my mother said, ‘ that Mr. Hinchcliffe did not really mean what he said to you, Constantia.’ And my father from the first had been of that opinion.’</p>

<p>A fitful, uncertain man like that may make twenty wills in a year.  I don’t think he sincerely intended you to believe what he said. I should put it out of my head, Constantia.’</p>

<p>But my father had to change his mind when one day Mr. Hinchcliffe, as he told us afterwards, walked into his study with the air of a man who had something of importance to say. He then told my father that he had made me the sole inheritor of all he possessed, and that doubtless the will would be contested.</p>

<p>‘ To provide you with material for the defence, sir,’ Mr. Hinchcliffe said, ‘ I pray you to pay this cheque into your bankers ; and when need arises, use it as I desire.’</p>

<p>‘ When I looked at the cheque,’ my father said, ‘ I saw it was for £1000. </p>

<p>‘ What did you do ? what did you say ?’ my mother asked.</p>

<p>‘I tore the cheque into fragments before his eyes, and threw it into the fire. I told him I would never lend myself to such an act as he proposed, nor let my daughter be enriched at the expense of his son.’</p>

<p>‘ He will never come near us again, poor old man,’ my mother said.</p>

<p> ‘ Let him keep away, then,’ my father exclaimed. ‘ He will come back fast enough.’</p>

<p>My father was right ; Mr. Hinchcliffe came as usual the next day. He was alone with my mother when he said :</p>

<p>‘ I respect your good husband’s motives, Lady Serena, though I deplore his want of courtesy to an old man. Will you undertake the business which he declines ?’</p>

<hr> <!--running (side) header is "April, 1862"-->

<p>My mother was, I think, sorely tempted, and what she said must have influenced Mr. Hinchcliffe in some way. He became more and more chivalrous and tender in his manner to her, and one day she told me that she thought Mr. Hinchcliffe had some good reason for what he did, and she added :</p>

<p>‘ Be kind to him, Constantia. He may not live long. ‘</p>

<p>He is not much older than papa,’ I said, ‘ and I hope he will live many years ; and, as he suggests, make a dozen different wills before he dies.’</p>

<p>The summer of this year was a very beautiful one. As I look back on it, it seems to me all sunshine and brightness. I went up frequently to the farm, and for the first time in my life I loved one who was dependent on me. Grace was better ; she could sit up now, and come down into the little parlour. I read to her, and taught her to colour some little pictures, and to copy flowers ; but she taught me lessons of faith and patience and love. She had her mission, and she fulfilled it.</p>

<p>At first her rough and rather ill-conditioned father looked suspiciously on me, and her mother said I must excuse, the master’s ways, but he had good reason to think ill of my brother ; and it was enough to break anybody’s heart to remember how blithe and bonnie and rosy their lassie was, and now she was but a poor faded flower at the best.</p>

<hr> <!--running (side) header is "June, 1862"-->

<p>One day I was returning from Uphill when I met a young man whom I recognised at once as Parsons’ son from the nursery gardens.</p>

<p>‘ I beg your pardon, miss,’ he said, ‘ for speaking ; but as you see Grace Turner sometimes, I would be glad if you could tell me how she is.’</p>

<p>‘ I think she is better now, though I fear it may be only a temporary improvement during the warm weather.’</p>

<p>‘ You know, miss, she was to have been my wife— that I have loved her ever since she was a little child; and you know who I have to thank for what has happened. I tell you what, Miss Carew, if it had not been for the grace of God I’d have made short work with him who did this mis chief; but though I think he deserves the worst that ever man could do, I leave him to God.’</p>

<p>I had nothing to urge in defence of my brother, and I could only be silent.</p>

<p>‘ The old people at the farm were to blame,’ Roger Parsons said ; ‘ especially the old man. He thought, I do believe, what with the money he had, and what with one thing and another, that he’d see his daughter married to a gentle man. Better see her in her grave ! though it breaks my heart to say it. I tried sending up a few flowers and fruit at first, but Mrs. Turner wouldn’t take them in. Might I be so bold as to send a few by you, Miss Carew, next time you go to the farm ? I’d leave them at the Rectory if I knew the day, for it would be a kind of comfort to me to know Grace touched them. She is so fond of flowers.’</p>

<p>‘ I shall be going to see her again on Monday,’ I said, ‘ and I will take the flowers gladly.’ The look of pain on the poor fellow’s face touched me. ‘ I am so sorry for you,’ I said. ‘ I wish I could make some amends to you for what you have suffered.’</p>

<p>‘ No one can do that,’ he said ; ‘ but I thank you, miss, for your kindness.’</p>

<p>Roger Parsons and I parted as friends, and I was for the first time in my life drawn out in sympathy to the people around us. I was learning how very small services are counted for great ones, if they are sweetened by sympathy. Unsympathetic service generally fails to bring back any harvest to those who render it. Have we not all felt this when we see gratitude is expected from us for a kindness done, or the act itself is set forth before us as something to be grateful for, the spring of response freezes within us. We cannot be forced into gratitude.</p>

<hr> <!--running (side) header is "August"-->

<p>Cuthbert was with us during August, and as usual met Mr. Hinchcliffe at the Rectory. We were in rather an unusual run of gaiety this summer. Croquet, or ‘garden-parties’ as they began to be called, were becoming very fashion able. The Carringtons at Moor Park took the lead, and others followed the example. Naturally our turn came, and when Cuthbert arrived he found us in the thick of preparation.</p>

<p>The lawn was rolled and mown over and over again ; there was a great manufacture of lemonade and claret-cup, unlimited boxes of Huntley and Palmer’s biscuits, and a good deal of home-made confectionery in the way of cakes and ‘ shapes.’ We did not aspire to ‘ ices,’ but the one fish-shop at Tessington supplied us with a large quantity of Wenham Lake blocks, and with this we cooled the beverages and iced our shapes of raspberry cream.</p>

<!--running (side) header is "August, 1862"-->

<p>‘ Garden-parties are a great deal of trouble,’ my mother sighed. ‘ After all, I think them very unsatisfactory. Imagine the disappointment if it rains this afternoon !’</p>

<p>‘But it won’t rain, my dear,’ my father ex claimed ; ‘ no chance of it.’</p>

<p>My father was in his element ; he was here, there, and everywhere, and superintending all the arrangements ; while my mother, as was her custom, took it all very quietly, she was ready dressed in a pretty grey silk before anyone, and seated herself under a large parasol on one of the garden-seats long before Rose and Bridget had put on their new picquet dresses, and long before I had thought of exchanging my lilac cotton for a blue muslin.</p>

<p>Cuthbert had arrived two days before, and was lying full length on the grass under a spreading lime-tree, where the bees were making the low murmurous sound which is always associated with the delicious scent of the lemon-coloured tassels of long flowers in which they delight.</p>

<p>‘These things are not much in your way, Constantia,’ he said, as, my labours finished, I approached the lime-tree, and seated myself near him. ‘ You have altered very much of late, Constantia.’</p>

<p>‘ Well,’ I said, ‘ we all grow old together.’</p>

<p>‘ Don’t fish for compliments ; you have been getting the prescription for the elixir in some queer way. I mean altered in tastes and habits. Fancy you three or four years ago bothering about a ” garden-party,” and putting on a swell gown for the occasion !’</p>

<p>‘ I think/ I said, ‘ that is a change for the better.’</p>

<p>‘ Did I say it wasn’t ?’</p>

<p>‘ You know I dined at Hinchcliffe Park last night.’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Now nothing had passed between me and Cuthbert about Mr. Hinchcliffe intentions. Except to my father and mother, I had not breathed a word about the will. Even Bridget and Rose were excluded from the confidence. ‘ They are two little sieves,’ my father had said ; and we could not trust them.</p>

<p>‘ Mr. Hinchcliffe was very confidential to me,’ Cuthbert continued ; ‘ he told me he wished to talk to me freely, as a ” man of law.” He read me a copy of his will, and, as you know, you are heiress by that will to all he possesses.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes ; but, Cuthbert, I should never take all the money. If I ever had it in my power I should provide for the rightful heir. I might take some.’</p>

<p>‘ I doubt if the option were given you. Guy Hinchcliffe would contest the will immediately. You don’t suppose he would quietly sit still.’</p>

<p>‘ But it would be lawful—legal, I mean. The will would stand.’</p>

<p>‘ I am not so sure. Likely as not the skeleton of his eminence the Cardinal and the four draped griffins’ heads on the bed-posts might be called proofs of insanity ; and Mr. Hinchcliffe’s will might be set aside on this ground.’</p>

<p>While Cuthbert was speaking I became conscious that my feelings had changed somewhat since the spring morning when the first announcement of Mr. Hinchcliffe’s intentions had moved me so strangely. I was now speaking of accepting the position, and providing for the lawful heir out of my grace and bounty. There had grown up within me, it seemed, a familiarity with my position as Mr. Hinchcliffe’s heir, and the vehement protest I had at first made would not be vehement now. In fact, I was ready for a compromise, but not for entire renunciation.</p>

<p>Still I said to Cuthbert, who lay with his hat tipped up over his eyes, so that I could hardly August, see his face :</p>

<p>‘ What would you advise me to do ?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing now; to reason with a man like Mr. Hinchcliffe is a mere waste of breath. The time for action lies in the future. Then— ‘</p>

<p>‘Then what?’</p>

<p>‘ You must relinquish your claim and let Guy Hinchcliffe have possession.’</p>

<p>‘ Would that be right towards Mr. Hinchcliffe, who leaves me the money to keep his son out of it ? That is his reason.’</p>

<p>‘Not all his reasons. One it may be, but not all.’</p>

<p>The colour rushed to my face. I knew what Cuthbert meant.</p>

<p>‘ Well, I hope you will be at hand to advise me for the best when the time comes. That will be some comfort, for we are all in these parts very ignorant as to business matters.’</p>

<p>‘ I am going to the Cape next winter,’ Cuthbert said, suddenly sitting erect.</p>

<p>‘ And give up your chambers and your work ?’ I asked, surprised. ‘ Well, I may return, but I have had a nasty cough for some time. The last doctor I saw told me I must not stay in England through another winter ; or if I did, it would not be above ground. So I am off. There is no one to leave who will care much — no one dependent on me ; and therefore it is easier for me to manage such a thing than for most people.’</p>

<p>‘We all care,’ I said. ‘Are you going alone ?’</p>

<p>‘ I think so ; it is nothing new to me to be alone.’</p>

<p>‘ Oh, Cuthbert !’ I exclaimed ; ‘ why do you say that ? You have so many friends in London, and know so many people.’</p>

<p>‘ Ah, don’t you remember those lines in ” Aurora Leigh ” about showing a hungry child waving cornfields, and the child’s practical and not poetical soul making her exclaim, ” A single loaf of wheaten bread would be better. I’m hungry ” ?’</p>

<p>We were interrupted here by the sound of carriage-wheels in the fir-tree avenue. And this first arrival was the signal for others. Our neighbours flocked in. Some in basket-carriages, some in more ambitious vehicles, while the Carringtons’ prancing steeds were drawn up as a final triumph before the door, and the fashionably attired inhabitants of Moor Park honoured us with their presence.</p>

<p>My father’s prophecy had been a correct one. The afternoon was one of cloudless brilliancy, but the heat was tempered by the moorland breezes, which have a freshness and exhilarating power in them peculiar, as I think, to the North Devon county.</p>

<p>Our party went off very well, and even the Miss Carringtons forgot their grandeur and entered heartily into a game of croquet played by the four champions of our district. In those days we — <i>i.e.,</i> good players — carried about with us our own mallets, marked with our mono grams, and the particular weight and thickness of those mallets was quite as much an object of interest as the tennis bat of to-day.</p>

<p>Poor old croquet ! It held its own for many years, but the age of perpetual motion into which we have drifted was too much for it ! It was swept down the stream to make way for the more energetic game of tennis, and the click of the balls on shaven turf and the ‘ take two off black,’ called in authoritative tones by the leader of a side, to a less accomplished player, belongs to a past generation.</p>

<p>As history repeats itself, croquet may return with such improvements as may render it popular to our children, who will remember hearing their mothers speak of it as an institution of their young days !</p>

<p>The guests cleared off between six and seven. The Carringtons departed with the flourish of superiority which belonged to them — a superiority seen in the very lustre of the silver buttons of the coats of the footman and coachman, folded so as to display them as they hung from the high box of the handsome carriage. Seen, too, in the restrained pace of the spirited pair of bays, as they went down the avenue ; seen, above all, in the air of smiling graciousness with which the occupants of the London-built landau bowed their farewell to my dear father, who saw all the guests to their carriages with his pleasant old-fashioned courtesy, which never failed.</p>

<p>Only two or three of the nearer neighbours were left when I saw standing on the lawn, looking always as if he belonged to a past age, Mr. Hinchcliffe. My mother glided up to him ; she never hastened to meet anyone. And he turned with her and seated himself by her side.</p>

<p>The few people who were left did not know Mr. Hinchcliffe, nor did he know them ; but his eyes followed the last game of croquet which some inveterate players were finishing, and when I looked in his direction he rose, bowed, with his hat in his hand, and reseated himself by my mother.</p>

<p>The action was not lost on Cuthbert ; it implied a certain distance in our relations which had not existed hitherto. And indeed I felt this distance was increasing, nor did I take any pains to bridge it over. It should never be said that I tried to ingratiate myself into the favour of the man who had elected me to be his heiress, and Cuthbert’s words were too fresh in my memory to be without their effect.</p>

<p>Strange though it may seem, however, it is true that Cuthbert’s outspoken way of putting before me the impossibility of inheriting Hinchcliffe Park, while Guy lived, kindled a little flame of opposition in me. In the mysterious complicated maze of motives which cross and recross each other within us at every point, there are times when it is impossible to find a clear path in the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Some of us are brave enough to face the difficulty, and allow of no weak compromise ; others there are, secure of final victory, who surrender themselves, soul and body, to the Guide in whose wisdom they trust. But I was not, at the time of which I am writing, taking either course. Rather, I was putting off the day of decision, and allowing myself to think sometimes how much I would do for others, when I could command wealth and position. I did not actually covet either, but I did not turn from them as undesirable. If Mr. Hinchcliffe voluntarily chose to endow me with his riches, and sought to heal the wounds of his bitter disappointment in those he had best loved, by taking refuge in our friendship for him as a family generally, and in me in particular, where was the blame to us ? Anything which came to me unsought could hardly be quite set aside ; and as I knocked about the balls in the game I was playing with Ada Wilson and my sister, this, and much more that was like it, passed through my mind.</p>

<p>‘ Constantia, how badly you are playing !’ Bridget exclaimed. ‘You are not thinking a bit about the game !’</p>

<p>‘ That is too bad, Constantia ! You have just sent my ball off hopelessly ; it’s such a shame ! You <i>can</i> play if you choose !’</p>

<p>And here my father, who had been, as I said, fully occupied with ‘seeing off’ his guests, came on the lawn.

<p>‘Ah! Mr. Hinchcliffe, welcome ! We are having a meal at eight o’clock ; not dinner, you know — just the remnants of the feast ; eh, my dear ? You will stay, of course, and join us. A pretty sight a croquet-party, isn’t it? Our lawn is small, but it is smooth. Do you know, my dear,’ still addressing my mother, ‘ I heard that young man who came with the Moor Park party say that he had never played on better turf ! Satisfactory, isn’t it? It has really been a great success. The only fault, you did not move about quite enough, my dear. However, I’ll excuse you, as you have three girls to entertain your guests.’</p>

<p>‘ I missed Awdry so much,’ my mother said ; ‘ he was always so useful when we had any little party. Cuthbert, on the contrary, is no use. He is one of those clever people who keep their cleverness to themselves.’</p>

<p>‘ And yet,’ Mr. Hinchcliffe said, ‘ with all due deference to your opinion, my Lady Serena, I know no more agreeable companion than Mr. Cuthbert Carew.’</p>

<p>‘ There was a sunny brightness about Awdry,’ my mother sighed. ‘ It is rather hard to think of him in this lovely weather shut up in a Boxton office.’</p>

<p>‘ Well, really, my dear,’ my father said, ‘ you and I managed to be very happy at Boxton in our young days ; and I expect Awdry is a great deal at Crofton. No one is to be pitied who has a place like the Ball-Bakers to go to when he chooses.’</p>

<p>We had rather a stiff and constrained meal. The presence of the Wilsons, and the Grants, who were our neighbours at Tessington, was evidently not agreeable to Mr. Hinchcliffe. Mr. Wilson was nervous and constrained in manner, and Mr. Grant shy and nervous. For Mr. Hinchcliffe was a sort of <i>bête noir</i> in the neighbourhood. As I have said, rumours of all kinds were afloat about him, and our dear father was considered to be too lenient towards the old Squire’s avowed dsibelief. ‘A man who never entered the church,’ they said, ‘ ought never to enter the Rectory as an accustomed guest.’ This judgment might be hard, but it was one which could hardly be avoided. What would they all think — what would they all say — did they know what had really passed between Mr. Hinchcliffe and me ? As we sat round the table that evening, the nether stream was running swift and strong; but who guessed it, as Mr. Hinchcliffe sat next my mother, talking over in his graceful fashion, with Cuthbert, some question of the day — quoting authors and poets who were as myths to our country neighbours, and arresting the attention of Mr. Wilson, although he tried to ignore him, and keep up a cross-fire of small nothings with Mr. Grant ?</p>

<p>Ah ! could they have known, I thought, the relations in which I stood to Mr. Hinchcliffe ! could they all know how bitter were the thoughts in his heart — how perplexed and uneasy in mine — what would they say ?</p>

<p>A modern writer has said, that if everyone had a piece of glass in the left side of his waist coat, through which his neighbours could see the working of the under-current, and read by magic power what is really passing in the inner heart of the man who is saying polite things to his ‘ friend,’ the friend would vanish. If we all knew what we thought of each other, friends would be an extinct genus !</p>

<p>Is it indeed so? Well may we turn with humble and thankful love to One Who knows <i>all</i> our weakness, infirmity of purpose — our secrets which are set in the Light of His countenance, and yet — ah, wonder of wonders which no mortal tongue can tell ! — loves us through all. As I write of this part of my life, and look back on my history as it stands written there, I feel that if I had not grasped this certainty of divine Love as my shield and strength, I could hardly have lived through the storm, but should have made shipwreck.</p>

<p>When the Wilsons and Grants were gone, we — that is, Cuthbert and I, my father and the girls — walked down the avenue with Mr. Hinchcliffe. He generally walked from the Rectory gate to the Park now ; and by a’ short cut through a field, the distance was scarcely a mile.</p>

<p>The night was so supremely beautiful, that we none of us were in haste to return. I remember, as Mr. Hinchcliffe fitted a key into a little door in the high wall which shut in the grounds, that as he turned with the dusky path through shrubs and rank undergrowth behind him, his figure was framed as it were by darkness and gloom.</p>

<p>For the crescent moon, sinking now, did not illuminate that dusky labyrinth, though she shed a silvery light on the open ground where we stood. The stars and Jupiter were brilliant in the blue arch above, but they too were hidden from Mr. Hinchcliffe by the interlaced branches of maples and higher growth of larches and beeches.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliffe stood for a moment or two as I describe, his hat in his hand. I was nearest to him, and I heard him say in the lowest and tenderest tones of his musical voice :</p>

<p>‘ Light for you, my child — for me darkness ;’ then the door closed, and my father’s cheery voice calling ‘ Good-night — good-night !’ awoke no response. We heard only the slow measured footfall on the other side of the high wall, as the dried carpet of fallen leaves of many an autumn crackled beneath it, and then we turned homewards.</p>

<p>Cuthbert and I fell together as of old. The girls and my father were in advance of us, talking of the croquet-party, of the necessity of cutting down two more laurel-bushes which were well known as traps for the erratic balls, and of other small details. We were silent for a long time, till we had nearly reached the shadow of our dark fir-trees.</p>

<p>The watching stars have always a solemn message for us when under the pressure of any heart-sorrow or perplexity. Their silence, and immeasurable distance, which make that silence for us, at once raise the immortal part upwards, yet make the mortal part acknowledge its own insignificance.</p>

<p>Their eternal majesty and calm, contrasts so forcibly with our perpetual movement and trivial worries, and little aims and plans. And yet in them what force, what gigantic action, what energy ! We are too far removed to recognise them, and thus that darkly blue firmament, with its countless stars all moving in the path appointed them from the beginning, represents to us the stillness and lofty calm which sheds over us its soothing influence. In those azure fields diamond-strewn, we think we see the beautiful foreshadowing of the peace for which, in this restless and sorrowful world, we crave. Even our joys and pleasures tire us, and in our search for knowledge we are too often weary. The heavens above seem to tell us of the City wherein the former things have passed away ; and the servants of the King can serve Him with ever-increasing vigour and untiring zeal.</p>

<p>Cuthbert stopped under the fir-trees, and with the abruptness to which I was well used, he asked : </p>

<p>‘Constantia, did Mr. Hinchcliffe ask you to marry him ?’</p>

<p>No one else dare have so roughly touched the tender place; but I did not resent it from Cuthbert.</p>

<p>‘ No ; but he said if he could have asked me to take his name, as well as his riches, he would have done so.’</p>

<p>‘ Do you see much of him now ?’</p>

<p>‘No — that is, he is here as usual, but we have only ordinary intercourse ; if there is any thing confidential, it rests between him and mamma.’</p>

<p>‘ Don’t have anything confidential then again ; it cannot be wholesome or right. I have heard that Mrs. Hinchcliffe only died a year or two since, not long after two daughters ; that his ungoverned temper obliged her and her children to leave him years ago. It is a dark story all round. I have been a little afraid, Constantia, your pity might deepen into what looked like love.’</p>

<p>‘You need not have been afraid. And now let us go in.’</p>

<p>‘Wait for a few minutes more. I may not ask such a thing of you again. We are old friends ; did it never strike you that to <i>me</i> our friendship meant something a great deal <i>more</i> than friendship ?’</p>

<p>Involuntarily I drew back a few steps, and he went on :</p>

<p>‘ It has not looked much like it, I confess. I have watched you all these years ; I have said to myself that I would speak out if I saw any one else in the field.’</p>

<p>I laughed rather bitterly.</p>

<p>‘You have been spared <i>that</i>, undoubtedly. No one has ever been in the field.’

<p>‘ So I thought. Well, I come of a consumptive race ; I stand alone, as you know, the last of five brothers and sisters, and parents dying early in life from the same disease. You know this ?</p>

<p>‘ Yes, of course I have heard it.’</p>

<p>‘ I did not choose to run any risk of installing you as nurse to a wailing, irritable invalid ; if I had thought you loved me, it would have been different ; but I did not think you either did, or could care for me in that way. However, when I was here last, I fancied trouble might arise for you from that quarter yonder’ — pointing back with his stick towards Hinchcliffe Park — ‘ and I said to myself I would try my fate. Last spring I got a huskiness, and this little catching cough you hear. Other signs, too, of what was coming were not wanting.</p>

<p>‘ I went to a new doctor the other day, as I told you ; he ordered me at once to give up work, and not dream of wintering in England. He thinks me in a bad way,’ he added, after a short pause. ‘ I am glad now I did not seek to bind you. I don’t ask you to bind yourself now; it would be a cowardly and cruel thing on my part, and the kindness you have for me might make you fancy you could not refuse me what I asked, <i>if</i> I asked it — I am not going to ask it. I shall be sailing for the Cape early in September, but before I go I wanted to say that if anything happens at Hinchcliffe Park, I shall have some thing to do with it, for the old man hinted something about making me an executor. Not that I have seen the will, nor did he confide in me ; but he said he thought I, as a lawyer, could grapple with difficulties better than your good father. So, Constantia, you must keep up correspondence with me, and you will then know if I am dead or alive; if alive when Mr. Hinchcliffe dies, you must come to me for any help or assistance you want.’</p>

<p>‘ But you will come back quite well — you are not very ill ?’</p>

<p>And then, as I said the words, I thought how thin he was — how large and bright his eyes often were, gleaming on me out of the dusk and shadows. But I repeated :</p>

<p>‘ You are not very ill ? Oh, Cuthbert, pray, pray don’t say you will never come back !’</p>

<p>He drew a step nearer me, and took my hand in his.</p>

<p>‘ Poor little hand !’ he exclaimed, ‘ how cold it is ! I may come back ; if it is God’s will, I shall come back ; but something tells me I can never be a strong man. You know I have had that sign which is so unmistakable. I have seen crimson spots on my handkerchief several times !’</p>

<p>‘ So has Grace Turner,’ I said — ‘ so has Grace Turner, and she is better ; she gets out now into the garden. Consumption does not always kill people.’</p>

<p>He took both my hands — the little cold hands — in his, which were, I felt, burning hot, and he said :</p>

<p>‘ Of late I have been able to commit myself into His Hands Whom I wish to serve. It is perfect surrender, and I have felt quite safe ever since. Constantia, before I go, I should like to feel <i>you</i> are in that keeping — that <i>you</i> have surrendered yourself.’</p>

<p>‘ I can’t talk of it,’ I said ; ‘ but I think I have learned a great deal from Grace Turner. You know about her and Awdry ?’</p>

<p>‘ Yes ; but it is of <i>you</i> I want to talk now ; then he drew my hand within his arm, and spoke quietly and calmly of death and life — of the passing from the one to the other. He spoke of his past freely : how he had doubted and given up Faith, and lived in the atmosphere of what is now called Agnosticism — the ‘not knowing,’ the ‘ unknowing.’ Then how the society of men, and women too, of this type had charmed him, and yet at times how restless he had been. How often, when he had come to us at Cranworth, he was uneasy and troubled, though he would not acknowledge it to himself. Then there was a change — he expressed it as a veil lifted— as light breaking in, showing himself as he was, but God as He is.</p>

<p>‘ It is not <i>knowing,</i> even now,’ he said, ‘ but it is <i>feeling</i> the witness within. The good people called Quakers say it is the ” inward light.” I don’t care to give it a name, but whatever it is, it shows me the Cross, and on it the Lord Who died there ; and it gives <i>me</i> the real interest in Him for which my soul had longed.’</p>

<p>It was so new to hear Cuthbert speak like this, so new that it smote me with this fear :</p>

<p>‘ He thinks he may never talk to me again, or he would not talk thus.’</p>

<p>‘ I pray you may find this Light,’ he said, ‘ Constantia; it will guide you into all truth, and give you a right judgment in everything, present and future. I shall come and bid you all good-bye before I leave England, but I shall not say much then. <i>This</i> is our real farewell.’</p>

<p>We were almost at the door now ; the bending willow-tree loomed in the darkness before us ; lights twinkled in the windows ; a bat wheeled round the gabled roof of the Rectory, and above us were the watching stars.</p>

<p>My heart beat with strange and conflicting emotions, but solemn awe, as if in the presence of something unseen, wrapped me round. Cuthbert bent his head and kissed me on the forehead, and then, without another word, we passed into the house.</p>

<hr> <!--Extra space in between paragraphs.-->

<p>Two or three days later, the morning post brought a letter in a large important lilac envelope, sealed with a brilliant gold cypher and crest — a fashion which was at this time much followed. The letter was addressed to me, and was handed to me by my father. ‘</p>

<p>That is from Barbara Ball-Baker, I am sure.’</p>

<p>‘Old Double B.’s wife,’ Rose exclaimed. ‘ Cousin Barbara, is she not, mamma ?’</p>

<p>‘ What can she be writing to me about ?’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p>My mother’s eyes were rather anxiously fixed on the letter ; and she said :</p>

<p>‘ Nothing about Awdry, I hope ? I mean, he is not ill ?’</p>

<p>‘ Nonsense, my dear ; Barbara would not write to Constantia if Awdry were ill. Ball-Baker would write to me, of course.’</p>

<p>‘ My father is right,’ I said ; ‘ the ” triple B ” has written to ask me and Bridget to pay Crofton a visit. Here, you can read the letter, mamma. It is very short ; and what a hand ! all tails and strokes !’</p>

<p>The sheet of very thick glazed and ribbed lilac note-paper was covered on all four sides, it is true, but the words were few.</p>

<p>‘ DEAR MISS CAREW, ‘</p>
	<p>It will afford ‘ (I fear there was only one <i>f</i>) ‘ Mr. Ball-Baker and myself great pleasure if you and your next-eldest sister will make it convenient to pay a visit to The Beeches, from the 10th of August to the 25th. ‘</p>
<p>With kind compliments to your papa and mamma,</p>
			<p>‘ Yours truly,</p>
				<p>‘Barbara Ball-Baker.’</p>

<p>‘ Nothing about Awdry, then. Of course you must go, Constantia,’ my mother said ; ‘ and it will be a nice change for Bridget.’</p>

<p>‘ Oh, I shall like it very much,’ Bridget said.</p>

<p>‘ I wish I were going too/ Rose sighed. ‘ Crofton is a very pretty place, and the Ball-Bakers’ is a splendid house, isn’t it, mamma ? though they are such vulgar people.’</p>

<p>‘ I have never stayed at this new place of theirs, my dear. When your father and I were at St. Michael’s, Boxton, the Bakers lived in a much smaller way ; and Mrs. Baker is his second wife. She was a widow, with two daughters ; and very wealthy, I believe.’</p>

<p>‘ Mr. Ball-Baker is your cousin, isn’t he, mamma ?’</p>

<p>‘ His first wife was my cousin.’</p>

<p>‘ She must have married beneath her,’ Rose, who was always fully alive to the merits of her family connection to Awdrys and Carews, said.</p>

<p>‘ Hush, my dear Rose,’ my mother said. ‘ The Ball-Bakers are very kind about Awdry ; pray don’t run them down.’</p>

<p>My father, who had been called out to see the clerk about a wedding, now came back.</p>

<p>‘ Well, what is the letter about ? Give it to me. Oh ! an invitation. You must go, of course. A very nice thing for you, Constantia ; and they are people we must cultivate. We have been very remiss about it hitherto, and a great pity it has been. The day is gone by for anyone to despise trade. I am very glad you should go ; so mind you are ready to start on the fifteenth of August ; and write and accept the invitation at once.’</p>

<p>The little bustle and excitement was, I think, good for me. I was haunted with the thoughts of Cuthbert going out, as I firmly believed, to die alone in a foreign land. Surely mine was a very unusual position. After years of the most uneventful routine, I found myself made the heiress of one man, for the affection, if not love, he bore me ; and another, the friend of many years, had suddenly told me that his friendship had been love, and that nothing but the certainty of his condition prevented him from asking me to be his wife.</p>

<p>I could hardly tell him what was really in my heart — that I would go with him, and take care of him, cheer his loneliness, and be his nurse. He said so distinctly that he did not wish or ask me to do this. Then the question arose of whether it was ‘ the thing called love,’ or friendship, or sympathy, or pity, which had stirred my soul to its deeps. I did not know then. I know now !</p>

<p>My father was much interested in our visit to Crofton, and called me into the study to ask if I had everything that I wished for in the way of dress.</p>

<p>‘ They are smart people there, who think a great deal of the outside of things, I expect. Here is a five-pound note ; get anything you like with it for yourself and Bridget.’</p>

<p>Five pounds was a great deal to us in those days ; now, I fear, two sisters going forth for a visit to ‘ smart people ‘ would not consider it a very princely gift. But it went a long way towards the replenishing of our wardrobes.</p>

<p>We started on our travels on the fifteenth of August, and Jess was more than usually obstinate on her way to the station. She had, when crossed, several very uncomfortable habits, one of which was to back or ‘ jib ‘ persistently when she was requested to take a turn she did not approve.</p>

<p>My father and Jess had always a contest about a ‘ short cut ‘ to the station at Tessington, and this morning she was particularly determined to contest the point.</p>

<p>The ‘short cut’ was really of little importance ; and if a minute were saved by the turn into Stag Lane, a good many were wasted by the conflict.</p>

<p>‘ Don’t force Jess, papa,’ I said. ‘ I know some day she will do harm if you persist in making her come this way.’</p>

<p>‘ I’ll teach her,’ said my father ; ‘ I am not going to give in. The obstinate brute— ‘</p>

<p>And Jess and her master had a conflict, which ended in victory for Jess. We had to turn round at last, and avoid Stag Lane.</p>

<p>There were very few people at the station. Tessington had scarcely yet awoke to the ad vantage of the branch line, and a great many of the farmers and country people still preferred to jog along in their carts with their produce, rather than have the trouble of booking at the station at a given hour.</p>

<p>To be tied and bound to any given course of action was a penance to the free North Devon moor folk, who loved their own way, and continued to get it, very much as Jess did.</p>

<p>We were off at last ; my dear father bustled about with our modest amount of luggage, saw it labelled, adjured us not to lose our tickets, and at parting put his head in at the window and said :</p>

<p>‘ Mind you write full particulars of Awdry ; and take care you see your luggage in at the Junction.’</p>

<p>He treated us like children still, my dear kind father. Ah, how we long in later life for this fatherly solicitude, which perhaps at the time we may resent ! ‘ Grown-up children ‘ are still children to their fathers and mothers, and the time which separates the schoolboy from the man, and the girl in her teens from the woman of thirty, is forgotten. The affectionate care for us in all the minutest details of our lives cannot be repeated when our fathers and mothers are taken from us. Then we learn what it is to be separated from the days of youth and childhood, and years seem at once added to our age… As the generation above us falls, we take its place, and realize that we are going down into the shadows of middle life.</p>

<p>The second-class carriages were in those days most unmistakably second-class, and as uncomfortable as hard narrow seats and small windows could make them.</p>

<p>Bridget was a little disturbed by meeting the Carringtons at Exeter, where we made our second change. They were standing apart from their luggage, which was under the care of their maid and footman, and were perfectly at their ease, while we were obliged to watch our two boxes, and had no one to hold our bags and cloaks.</p>

<p>The Carringtons’ greeting was not too cordial, I thought. They inquired for Rose, and asked us if we were going to Lord Heatherton’s.</p>

<p>‘ No,’ said Bridget, blushing ; ‘ we are going to Crofton, to the Ball-Bakers? ‘</p>

<p>Lord Heatherton has a large party this week in the house, for the militia are in camp on Hamworth Hill. I thought you might be going to meet Lady Awdry there.’</p>

<p>That Audry relationship held our heads a little above the stream in the country, but was scarcely more than empty honour.</p>

<p>At last the train came gliding up, and the Carringtons were escorted to their carriage by their servants, and Bridget and I had to scamper down the long line to find two second-class seats.</p>

<p>‘ Second-class this way !’ shouted a porter, and we found ourselves seated with the servants from Moor Park, and a clergyman from Exeter, who kindly gave me the seat by the window, and was very kind and agreeable.</p>

<p>Bridget sank into silence, and really felt the humiliation of being elbowed by the maid, who gave herself airs, complaining of the ‘eat, and flirted with the footman in a very marked and objectionable way.</p>

<p>Bridget’s penance did not last long. Hamworth Junction was only an hour from Exeter, and here our carriage was cleared, and the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>Bridget recovered her spirits at Boxton, for a smart footman, wearing livery which was very conspicuous in the crowd, was on the platform with Awdry waiting for us.</p>

<p>Awdry was, as usual, perfectly at ease, and greeted us with becoming <i>sang froid.</i> He knocked the ashes off the end of his cigar and threw it away, saying :</p>

<p>‘ How much luggage have you ?’</p>

<p>‘ Two boxes and a carpet-bag,’ I replied, turning towards the place where the crowd was thick and vociferous.</p>

<p>‘ I’ll take you to the carriage/ Awdry said ; then addressing the footman, ‘There are two boxes and a bag. This way, Constantia.’</p>

<p>‘ Will the luggage be all right, Awdry ?’</p>

<p>‘ Of course ; don’t trouble yourself about it. We have to go up those steps.’</p>

<p>Awdry did not attempt to relieve either of us of our bags, and we kept up to him with great difficulty, threading our way through flys and cabs, and deafened by the noise, and metallic-voiced omnibus-conductors, to the large yellow carriage with its hammer-cloth and conspicuous coat of arms painted on the panel, in which Awdry placed us. He leaned against the door for a moment to say :</p>

<p>‘ I shall see you at dinner, for I am coming up to The Beeches. I must say good-bye now ; the luggage will go up on a fly, I expect. I dare say you will have to wait a few minutes ; there is always a crowd at Boxton.’ Then he took off his hat, and disappeared.</p>

<p>‘ What an affectionate brother !’ Bridget exclaimed ; ‘ but how handsome he is !’</p>

<p>‘ Yes,’ I said, ‘ he is as handsome as an utterly selfish person can be ; but I think the expression of his face is altered for the worse.’</p>

<p>‘ I don’t believe he is working here any more than he did at home.’</p>

<p>‘ No. I expect he will have to be shipped off to Australia, as Charlie advises ; and it will be a great relief.’</p>

<p>‘ It will break mamma’s heart,’ Bridget said. ‘ But, Constantia, what a grand carriage this is ! I wish the Carringtons could see us. I really did <i>not</i> like travelling with those servants. I was only glad it was not Rose, because she has been staying so lately at Moor Park. It must be nice to be rich — naturally rich, I mean ; not vulgarly rich, with money made by trade.’</p>

<p>‘ That is nonsense, Bridget,’ I said ; ‘ and pray do not air any such old Tory notions here, or I don’t think you will get the chance of being met at Boxton again by this magnificent carriage. Here comes the servant.’</p>

<p>The footman now came up to the door, touched his hat respectfully, and saying, ‘The luggage is all put on a fly,’ he mounted to his high pinnacle, and we moved off.</p>

<p>Boxton had once been my home, but I had never felt I had a part or lot in it ; and indeed my father’s parish, which had then been in the suburbs, was now so built round and buried by a multitude of new houses, that the church itself was perhaps the only thing left to recall the past to us. I recognised the fine old tower, and pointed it out to Bridget. She too remembered it, but she had only been eight years old when we left Boxton, and said she had thought the tower was so much higher.</p>

<p>The sleek carriage-horses did not hurry themselves, even after we had left the crowded thoroughfares of Boxton and had reached the open ground of villas and terraces and squares, which were things apart and above this great manufacturing town of the west.</p>

<p>We passed by an endless succession of these squares and villas, and then left them behind us, as we crossed an open down and turned down a road shaded by trees, at the end of which, gates and a lodge warned us that The Beeches was nearly reached.</p>

<p>A small, old-fashioned house had in days past stood in the grounds through which we drove. It had been swept away, and on its site stood a palatial residence with a tower and grand facade, which was ornamented by figures and scrolls of beautiful carving, and had only one fault, which time would mend — the fault of being too new.</p>

<p>As with the gold cypher on the lilac paper — as with the yellow carriage and emblazoned arms on the panels — as with the shining plated harness of the fat horses and the scarlet liveries of the servants, so with the interior of The Beeches ; everything looked too much like money. There were three servants in the hall, and our names were entrusted to each in succession, and we followed a portly butler at last through a long vista of rooms, all ablaze with gilt and mirrors and blue and crimson satin, over carpets so soft that no footfall could be heard, to a smaller room, which opened into a conservatory, where we found at last Mrs. Ball-Baker.</p>

<p>We had no reason to complain of our reception ; it was kind and cordial.</p>

<p>‘ I am very glad to see you. As I told your good father, we ought to know each other. There’s a portrait of your relation upstairs, and I declare it’s very like you — Constantia, isn’t it ? Excuse me a minute.’</p>

<p>A pale, highly-decorated little girl now came timidly in.</p>

<p>‘ Mamma, may I ask Mrs. Hinchcliffe to stay to tea ? she is so tired.’</p>

<p>‘ These are your cousins, the Miss Carews, Mimsie. Isn’t she a mite ? she is thirteen, and no bigger than nine — bless her ! I call her little and good. Mrs. Hinchcliffe is a poor music-mistress who teaches Mimsie. Poor soul ! she has a lot of children, and is hard put to it to find them bread. Yes, to be sure ; tell Mrs. Redmond to stay to tea, and tell Barker to cut a little cold meat.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma, Mrs. Hinchcliffe looks so ill to-day ; I wish— ‘</p>

<p>‘ There, there, my dear, run off. I am engaged with your cousins.’</p>

<p>Little Mimsie departed. She was, in spite of flounces and ribbons and elaborate curls, a pretty child.</p>

<p>‘She is our only one, and a great pet,’ her mother said. ‘ She is too delicate to do much in the way of study; but she has taken to music, and I was asked by the Vicar of St. Mary’s to patronize this person you hear her talking of — Mrs. Hinchcliffe.’</p>

<p>‘Hinchcliffe!’ Bridget exclaimed. ‘I wonder if it is any relation to our Mr. Kapel Hinchcliffe, the Squire ?’</p>

<p>‘ Lor’, no, my dear ; I should think not. These poor people are quite in humble circumstances, though they have seen better days.’</p>

<p>I was silent ; but I knew Hinchcliffe was not a common name, and it flashed across my mind perhaps this is Guy Hinchcliffe’s wife.</p>

<p>The tea now came in, by the help of two or three servants and while we were enjoying it, Mrs. Ball-Baker gave us a great deal of information.</p>

<p>‘ Only one of my elder daughters is at home.’ (Mrs. Ball-Baker’s ‘ h’s ‘ were somewhat erratic, but I will not trouble those who read my history to leave out these little aspirates in the right places or put them in in the wrong ones. If ugly when spoken, the effect is worse when written.) ‘ Only one is at home ; the other is visiting in Scotland. There’s a beau there, we think, but it isn’t come to a proposal yet! My second daughter makes great friends with your brother, but he isn’t the sort of man I wish for. Julia would twist him round her thumb in no time. He is handsome enough, but he is very lazy. I think you’ll have to give him a gentle hint.’</p>

<p>My heart misgave me as to any gentle hint from me having any effect on Awdry. He had had ‘ gentle hints ‘ too long ; he needed some sharper admonitions.</p>

<p>‘ He is a very handsome young man,’ Mrs. Ball-Baker continued ; ‘ but a little bird whispered to me that he did next to nothing in the office, and of course it’s very unpleasant to have head clerks lodging complaints against anyone who is a family connection. But we’ll talk of that another time. Here’s several invitations which will concern you two ; one to Croft Castle, to a garden-party. I suppose you don’t have garden-parties in North Devon ; it’s too much out of the world.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes, we do,’ Rose replied ; ‘ we had one at the Rectory last week.’</p>

<p>‘ I am sure I’m glad to hear it. I always like young folks to enjoy themselves. Here comes my Judy. Here, Judy, here are your cousins-in-law ;’ and Mrs. Ball-Baker laughed at her own joke till the long gold earrings hanging from her large ears danced like acrobats on a pole.</p>

<p>Judy — or Julia — Headlam was a very tall, very fashionably dressed young woman, past her <i>première jeunesse,</i> and quite as decidedly in the silver age as I was. But she dressed like seventeen, hunted and danced, and affected in all things the manners which were then beginning to be distinguished as ‘ fast.’</p>

<p>She was, like her mother, very good-natured, but she spoiled it by a blundering, tactless disregard of the feelings of other people. Not that she had any intention of saying or doing what might be distasteful ; she was simply too blunt in her own perceptions to know that she jarred upon others.</p>

<p>‘ Have you been shooting, Judy ?’ asked her mother.</p>

<p>‘ Of course ; practising for to-morrow. There is to be a tournament at the Castle, and it’s not likely I would risk being beaten there of all places.’</p>

<p>‘ There will be croquet as well as archery, to suit all parties,’ said Mrs. Ball-Baker ; ‘ so your cousins will have a turn.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma is very anxious to make out our relationship/ Julia said. ‘ I hope you have no objection ?’</p>

<p>Bridget laughed, and said ‘ Oh no,’ but I was silent.</p>

<p>I was tired, and longing to get to my room to rest a little before dinner.</p>

<p>This seemed at last to strike Mrs. Ball-Baker. She left her daughter reading a newspaper with her feet on a footstool, and escorted us upstairs.</p>

<p>‘ It’s a nice house, isn’t it ?’ she asked, with pardonable vanity, as she stopped at the head of the noble staircase, and told us to look down the wide corridor, which terminated in a beautiful picture of the interior of Cologne Cathedral, which was skilfully placed, with the light of two
dormer-windows falling on it. ‘Some people say they could fancy they were going to walk right into the cathedral. It’s very natural, isn’t it ? Now turn the other way.’</p>

<p>And here was a life-size full-length figure of a beautiful girl in white, with a long vista of forest behind her, stretching far, far into the distance. ‘</p>

<p>That is very beautiful,’ I said, cordially.</p>

<p>‘Yes, isn’t it? Mr. Ball-Baker gave three thousand pounds to have it to fix there ; it’s done by one of the Pre-Raffling School.’</p>

<p>A laugh from behind made me turn my head, and there was Julia.</p>

<p>‘ Poor mother never can get that word right,’ she said. ‘ But it is puzzling to the post-Raphaelite School.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t pretend to be learned, Judy. This way, my dears ;’ and our hostess led us to two delightful rooms, opening out of each other at the end of the corridor nearest to Cologne Cathedral, and left us.</p>

<p>Bridget was charmed, and could not sufficiently admire the furniture and surroundings.</p>

<p>‘ Look ! what a lovely view, Constantia !’ and we both went to a deep bay-window, with luxurious cushioned seats round it, to look out on the wooded undulating ground which sloped down to the edge of a steep precipice of rock, below which, at the depth of some two hundred feet, the dun-coloured river, which made the wealth of Boxton, ebbed and flowed, to and from the waters of the channel.</p>

<p>The drive wound through thick banks of arbutus and laurel towards the lodge, and as we were looking in that direction, we saw a slight, graceful figure leaning against the park-railings.</p>

<p>We were too far off to notice any minute details, but the first impression that figure made on me was a strong one.</p>

<p>The attitude expressed extreme weariness : the hands folded over the little roll of music, the head bent, and the wealth of gold-coloured hair catching the western sunshine.</p>

<p>‘That must be the music-mistress the child talked of,’ Bridget exclaimed ; ‘ what a shame to let her walk back into Crofton! Look, she is going on now : how slowly she is walking ! just as if she could hardly drag one foot after the other.’</p>

<p>It was indeed true, and as the figure of the music-mistress was hidden by a curve in the drive, I felt certain she and I were connected by a strange tie, and that she was the wife of the man whose inheritance his father had declared his intention of conferring on me.</p>

<p>When Bridget and I, having refused the services of a very smart maid, went into the drawing-room dressed for dinner, we found our host there before us.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball-Baker was a small man, who at first sight looked very young, almost like his wife’s son. But on nearer inspection, his pale thin face was found to be deeply lined, and the light hair cut closely to his head was very scant and grey. Mr Ball-Baker’s eyes were very near together, his forehead high and narrow, and his nose long and pointed. He greeted us civilly, not with any great cordiality ; and when Awdry was announced, I thought his manner was chilling in the extreme.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball-Baker was a leading Dissenter; he had built a spacious chapel, which was highly decorated, and he was the great man in his own sphere — so great that he fancied that sphere all-important, and himself the sun round which satellites moved. I think I never knew a man of more contracted views of life, nor one who read less of general literature.</p>

<p>His enormous fortune, of which The Beeches was the visible sign, was dispensed freely in all great matters, but Mr. Ball-Baker was mean almost to stinginess in small ones.</p>

<p>He had married the widow of a rich merchant, and her fortune was added to his wealth. Her two daughters were independent, and the only child by the second marriage was poor little ‘ Mimsie.’ She had been delicate from her birth, and her education was carried on in a desultory fashion by the help of masters and mistresses who were one after the other dismissed as likely to over-work the child’s brain.</p>

<p>Our dinner the first evening was very stiff and constrained. Mr. Ball-Baker was evidently a restraining power over his wife’s volubility, and Julia’s noisy rattle. Awdry was the most at ease amongst us, and certainly appeared to advantage by the side of a nephew of Mr. Ball-Baker’s, who was the living impersonation of a good-natured, thoroughly self-satisfied, prosperous snob.</p>

<p>That is an ugly word, and I use it with reluctance ; but how else can I describe Mr. Marmaduke Headlam — Duke, as he was commonly called ? As soon as we were in the drawing-room after dinner, and had left Mr. Ball-Baker to his reflections, I discovered that ‘ Duke ‘ was a very important member of the household at The Beeches. I believe he had professedly lodgings in Crofton, but they were but a name, and were only useful when he was too late in returning to awake the servants at The Beeches, for I need hardly say Mr. Ball-Baker allowed no latch-keys to any side-entrance door. The huge massive door under the mighty portico could not, indeed, be for a moment supposed to yield to a key. It was bolted and barred every night with considerable ceremony by the hall-servant, and no one could enter after that supreme moment.</p>

<p>Little Mimsie was in the drawing-room after dinner in a pink silk frock of many flounces, and her poor little thin arms and neck were painfully visible in her airy costume.</p>

<p>I thought of my father likening me to a grey pouter pigeon, and did not wonder that he thought Bridget and I should need some replenishing of our wardrobe. The Ball-Bakers were, as he told me, ‘ very smart people.’</p>

<p>The conservatory, which was a blaze of colour and rich with every variety of scent, all mingling in one delicious and subtle fragrance, tempted me to explore it.</p>

<p>I asked Mimsie to come with me. She took my hand at once, and led me through the first house to the fernery beyond. The terrace stretched invitingly in a cool emerald vista, ending in a cluster of graceful beeches, which gave the place its name. I was about to open the door and step out, when the child drew back.</p>

<p>‘ I must not come out with you,’ she said ; ‘ mamma never lets me go out after sunset.’</p>

<p>‘ Very well,’ I replied ; ‘ and in that dress you might feel the chill of the evening air. Have you any little friends to play with in these beautiful gardens ? ‘</p>

<p>No ; mamma doesn’t like me to mix with children ; she’s so afraid of infection.’</p>

<p>‘ Of what ?’ I asked, surprised.</p>

<p>‘ Hooping cough and scarlet fever, you know.’</p>

<p>‘ But little girls don’t go about with scarlet fever,’ I said.</p>

<p>‘ Ah, but mamma is so nervous,’ she replied. ‘ She would not have Mrs. Hinchcliffe at first because she had got little children at home ; but she made her promise to tell her the minute any of them had a complaint.’</p>

<p>‘ Do you like Mrs. Hinchcliffe ?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘ Yes, very much ; she is rather like you,’ she added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>‘ Like <i>me</i> ? Is she not very tall ?’</p>

<p>‘ Yes, and you are very short, I know ; but you speak like Mrs. Hinchcliffe, and your hands are like hers, white and soft and small,’ she added, caressing mine ; ‘ and she doesn’t wear rings and brooches, and you don’t either. Julia and Maude wear <i>heaps,</i> you know, and so does mamma.’</p>

<p>‘ And you wear them, too,’ I said. ‘ Of course I do. Mamma says that is a distinction between me and little girls who are not well off — not ladies ; and yet,’ and this was with a puzzled air, ‘ Mrs. Hinchcliffe is a lady, and of course you are.’</p>

<p>I laughed heartily. The child was so quaint and so unlike any child I had ever seen — a little old woman, with a pale, careworn yet pretty face, with her curls and her ornaments and her finery. She reminded me of a bird in a gilded cage — born in it, and knowing no other life, and pitying the happy brown thrushes and gay little finches which flew past it on the wings of freedom.</p>

<p>‘ You are a funny little thing !’ I exclaimed involuntarily ; ‘ I hope you will take me all through these beautiful grounds to-morrow, when you are more suitably dressed. Tell me about your music-mistress, Mrs. Hinchcliffe; where does she live ?’</p>

<p>‘In Crofton; I don’t know where exactly. She comes here twice a week to teach me ; and she goes to the Castle, too, to teach the little Miss Lauristons. She used to sing to me, but she can’t sing now ; she has a bad pain in her side if she tries.’</p>

<p>‘Next time Mrs. Hinchcliffe is here, may I come into your schoolroom and hear you have a lesson ?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, if mamma will let you. Sometimes I get leave to ask Mrs. Hinchcliffe to stay to tea ; and I’ll try to do so on Thursday, and then I’ll come and let you know, if you like.’</p>

<p>‘ I shall like it very much,’ I said.</p>

<p>And now there were voices approaching, and four figures passed the conservatory on the terrace — my brother and Julia Headlam, Bridget and Mr. Marmaduke Headlam.</p>

<p>‘ We had better go back to the drawing-room,’ I said ; and I was turning away from the door leading to the terrace when a sharp unmusical voice behind me made me start.</p>

<p>‘ Why, papa, how you frightened me !’ Mimsie said. ‘ Yes, I am going to bed. I know it’s past nine.’</p>

<p>The little pale face was lifted to mine for a kiss, and then the little thin arms were thrown round her father’s neck. ‘ Good-night, my pet !’ I heard Mr. Ball-Baker say ; ‘ good-night !’ and when his face was raised from his little daughter’s, the hard lines seemed softened, and a smile had parted those closely-compressed lips.</p>

<p>‘I wanted to have a word with you, Miss Carew,’ my host said. And then, with not the best possible taste, he said that Awdry’s behaviour in his office caused a great deal of trouble. He asked me to remonstrate, and let Awdry know that unless there was some very marked change, he could not allow him to continue in his office.</p>

<p>It was a thankless task for me, and I dreaded it. Why should anything so distasteful be put upon me? I thought. And there was the other matter of Grace Turner. I had not yet referred to it, and I felt I must do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball-Baker having dismissed the subject of Awdry, condescended to tell me the name of many of his rare plants, and gave me not only their pedigree, but that of his head-gardener, Macpherson, who had begun life in the service of a Scotch earl, and afterwards held a post at Chatsworth.</p>

<p>While Mr. Ball-Baker was speaking, he un happily turned quickly, and by some sudden movement of his arm broke off a large frond of a magnificent cloth-of-gold fern, which, as he told me, was likely to win the first prize at the next flower-show.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball-Baker evidently stood much in awe of the man who had served an earl and a duke, and the appearance of Macpherson himself at this moment had an amusing effect on him ; he looked like a naughty child caught in mischief Macpherson had come to examine the temperature of the Fernery before retiring for the night ; and Mr. Ball-Baker advanced to him with the large frond in his hand.</p>

<p>‘ A sad misfortune, Macpherson.’</p>

<p>The gardener’s face changed.</p>

<p>‘ Misfortune ? It’s a sin and a shame ! Who did it, sir ?’</p>

<p>And I felt that Macpherson was looking to wards me as the probable culprit.</p>

<p>‘ I — I did it. The plant was placed much too near the edge of the stand. But I hope it’s not much damaged ?’</p>

<p>‘ Damaged ? It’s just ruined ! Ah, weel, Mr. Baker, you’ll just have no cloth-of-gold fern to send to the show, and you’ll just miss the first prize ; but maybe you’ll not take account of that part. Aye, dear, it’s a great pity ;’ and Macpherson turned his back on his master, and in answer to a question about a lycopodium, preserved a sullen silence ; and, much crest-fallen, Mr. Ball-Baker departed with the beautiful frond in his hand.</p>

<hr> <!--Extra space in between paragraphs.-->

<p>I had no opportunity of speaking to my brother that night, and indeed he avoided me ; I felt sure he was afraid that I might be commissioned, as I was, to tell him that Mr. Ball-Baker was dissatisfied with him. The garden-party at the Castle was a very large one. Bridget and I followed our hostess and her daughters into the drawing-room, where the guests were received, and were introduced as the Miss Carews — our cousins from Devonshire.</p>

<p>Mrs Lauriston said she was glad to see us ; hoped we would have some tea or coffee, and then was of course obliged to attend to other guests. We were soon separated from Mrs. Ball-Baker, and I caught a last sight of her grass-green satin with its yellow trimmings on its way through the crowd to join some friends. Julia also soon forgot our existence, and we two sisters were alone in the crowd.</p>

<p>It is always desolate to feel forsaken amongst a gay concourse of people, all chattering to each other, and all apparently on friendly terms. Bridget and I seated ourselves on a bench on the lawn, and were quite unnoticed. Some times the passers-by stared at us with a cold kind of wonder at our audacity in occupying that position !</p>

<p>Presently Bridget said :</p>

<p>‘ Let us walk about together, Constantia. It is so dull not to know anyone ; and how rude of the Ball- Bakers to leave us like this ! There are a great many vulgar-looking people about here ; don’t you think so ?’</p>

<p>‘ Hush !’ I replied ; ‘ some of the ” vulgar-looking people ” will hear you.’</p>

<p>‘ And such voices !’ Bridget went on ; ‘ they have all a twang, and talk so loud. Look at Julia Headlam, how she is trying to be young. I suppose they are going down to the targets. Shall we go ?’</p>

<p>‘ I want to explore the Castle grounds,’ I said. ‘ I know they are beautiful. Before the Lauristons bought it, it was a show place ; and I have been here when I was a child for a treat with Charlie and Hugh.’</p>

<p>‘ How I wish we had our nice brothers at home, and could get rid of Awdry. It is hard to lose the best and keep the worst.’</p>

<p>‘ It is never good taste to abuse your own kith and kin,’ I said. ‘ Now I will come if you like.’</p>

<p>We passed from the gardens to a winding path through a wood, and following it for some time, came out, as I knew we should, on the edge of the rocks overhanging the river.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day of late summer ; a blue haze hung like a veil over the distant range of Welsh mountains, and lent a charm to the dun-coloured waters of the Channel, and the river below running out to meet it.</p>

<p>Bridget and I seated ourselves here, and were glad to be far away from the gay crowd, in which we had no interest. We were not long left undisturbed, for the sound of coming feet made us look round, and there was Mr. Marmaduke Headlam, who had just arrived, with Awdry and another friend.</p>

<p>‘I say,’ Mr. Headlam exclaimed, ‘ I have been hunting for you everywhere. Come and watch the shooting ; they are going in for a prize, and Judy is safe to win.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes, it’s absurd your moping here,’ said Awdry ; ‘ do come.’</p>

<p>I rose from the bench and followed Bridget and Mr. Headlam, putting my hand through Awdry’s arm to keep him a little behind the others.</p>

<p>‘ I wanted to speak to you, Awdry,’ I began.</p>

<p>‘ Oh, bother it ! don’t begin to preach, Constantia. A garden-party is not the right place for sermons.’</p>

<p>‘ I must speak,’ I said ; ‘ it is about the office. Mr. Ball-Baker says you are doing nothing to any purpose there ; that you are very unpunctual in your attendance. And in short, Awdry, if you do not change at once, you must leave his office ; he cannot keep you.’</p>

<p>‘ I am sure I am glad to hear it. I don’t want to stay.’</p>

<p>‘ And what are you going to do ?’</p>

<p>‘ I’m sure I don’t know. I shall find some thing.’</p>

<p>‘ I cannot think how you can be so selfish,’ I replied. ‘ Cuthbert told me — ‘</p>

<p>Pray don’t quote that prig to me, Constantia ! I can’t stand it !’</p>

<p>‘ Well, I will quote no one ; but I must tell you that you have done mischief enough already which you can never repair. Grace Turner is broken down in health, and all by your means. Then there was the debt to her father— ‘</p>

<p>Awdry started now, and his handsome face flushed crimson.</p>

<p>‘ Debt ! — nonsense !’ ‘ The debt is paid,’ I continued, ‘ and I wish I could think it was the only one.’</p>

<p>‘ It was all a swindle of that old man’s,’ he said ; ‘ but if you like to throw your money away, it’s all one to me. Now then, if you are not coming to the archery-ground, I must leave you.’</p>

<p>‘ Do let me speak to you as your eldest sister,’ I pleaded.</p>

<p>‘ Eldest sister indeed ! You have been no sister to me — shut up with your books, setting yourself up to be clever and superior, and all the rest of it. It is too late now for me to care for anything <i>you</i> may say. I’ll tell old Double-B that he might as well speak to me straight out, instead of setting my sister upon me.’</p>

<p>‘ But about the Turners, Awdry ; do you know what misery and sorrow you caused Grace?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I can’t help it. You would not have had me marry a farmer’s daughter, would you ? If I had done that, you might have grumbled.’</p>

<p>‘You persuaded her you loved her,’ I said; ‘you were the cause of her breaking off her engagement to a good, honourable man in her own rank of life ; and had it not been for the help of God, that poor girl might have fallen still lower. You promised to marry her secretly, and you know you had no intention of marrying her at all.’</p>

<p>I had spoken out now, and I had told the truth ; but my words seemed to have but little effect. Awdry muttered something under his breath and strode away.</p>

<p>‘ I can do no good,’ I sighed, ‘ no good ; why should I try? He is utterly hardened, and I only make things worse.’</p>

<p>But ah ! if I had done my part as an elder sister years before, would it have come to this ? I turned back to the seat where Bridget and I had been sitting, and tears of self-reproach and wounded feeling fell from my eyes.</p>

<p>Was it indeed too late? Cuthbert’s words returned to me, as many of his words did, sounding from a vanished time :</p>

<p>‘ We have all to do with each other ; we are all bound up in the bundle of life with our kith and kin.’</p>

<p>How often I had taken refuge in the very easy doctrine of having ‘ nothing to do with Awdry ‘ ! I had kept aloof and apart, and I had rather prided myself on it, and now — now that wider and higher views of life were breaking upon me, just as mountain-peaks, unseen in the dim light of early day, stand forth when the sun’s rays illuminate them, so I seemed to see the wide spread power of the influence which cometh of love — for <i>good</i> ; and the widespread influence that cometh of indifference — for <i>evil</i>.</p>

<p>Indifference, utter carelessness as to other lives running parallel with our own, called by August, no harsher name, works untold mischief. I was quick enough to see Awdry’s faults — they were visible enough to every eye — I could denounce him with the stinging words which must, I now knew, have pierced my gentle mother’s heart ; but had I ever tried what the power of a strong nature over a weak one could do, if exercised for good ?</p>

<p>For Awdry was weak, so weak that a straw’s weight would turn him from any purpose ; and I had as I knew, and those who lived with me knew, a strong will.</p>

<p>‘ It is too late now,’ my brother had said, and the very words had a depth of sadness in them which almost surprised me. I had never thought I was selfish in days past ; now I saw how unutterably selfish I had been. Did not even Cuthbert see me as I was ? I could not help thinking that had he been sure of his ground, he would not have hesitated to ask me to go to the Cape with him as his wife. That he loved me, I knew now ; but he did not think I could love him, or anyone, with that whole-hearted devotion in which self is lost — in the ocean of entire self-forgetting.</p>

<p>I felt now like one who was holding out pleading hands to the departing angel who had come unawares, and finding no resting-place had spread its wings and fled. That angel is the opportunity given us all in our life-time to do all, and suffer all for love’s sake. We heed it not ; we are blind, and see it not ; and at last there is an awakening, and then there remains nothing but the mournful consciousness that for that opportunity at least it is too late.</p>

<p>A sound of quick breathing and a short cough made me turn my head, and a tall, fair woman, very plainly dressed, came up to the place where I was sitting. I saw at a glance it was Mrs. Hinchcliffe, Mimsie’s music-mistress.</p>

<p>‘ I beg your pardon/ she said ; ‘ I was looking for my little boy, who has strayed away from me.’</p>

<p>‘ Do sit down,’ I said, ‘you look so tired.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes, I am always tired. Mrs. Lauriston was so kind as to ask me to come here this afternoon, and bring my two elder children. I thought it would be a treat for them, but I am sorry I attempted it. I cannot think where my Kapel can be.’</p>

<p>That name ! I had no doubt now this <i>was</i> Mr. Hinchcliffe’s daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>‘ Will you let me look for your little boy ?’ I asked. ‘ Did he come in this direction ?’</p>

<p>‘ I think so ; if Beata is with him it is all right, but she went off with Miss Lauriston to the archery-ground, I am afraid. I hope Kapel has not strayed near the edge of the rock.’</p>

<p>She pressed her hand to her side, and looked anxiously around her.</p>

<p>‘ I will go and look for the boy/ I said, ‘ if you will sit quietly here. I shall find him, I dare say ; but please sit still.’</p>

<p>I saw a path leading along the edge of the rock, which was guarded by a light iron railing, and called the boy by his name — that name so familiar to me.</p>

<p>‘ Kapel !’ ‘ Kapel !’ My voice echoed from the opposite side of the ravine through which the river ran, and then died away into silence. There was a band playing in the archery-ground, and the strains of a waltz came to my ear mellowed by distance, rising and falling as the breeze which carried it towards me rose and fell. Presently I heard a voice — a child’s voice :</p>

<p>‘ Beatrice ! mother !’ and again ‘ Beatrice !’</p>

<p>‘ Kapel !’ I called ; ‘ is that you ? Where are you?’</p>

<p>‘ Here ; please come — and — don’t be long.’</p>

<p>The words seemed to be spoken with difficulty, and I ran as fast as the tangled grass and unevenness of the path would let me towards the place whence the voice seemed to come. The park railing I have mentioned came to an end with the grounds of the Castle, and a gate led into some open ground also skirting the rocks. I reached this gate, and heard the voice once more :</p>

<p>‘ Mother ! oh, mother !’</p>

<p>I climbed over the gate, and went along the edge of the rock, carefully feeling my way with my parasol. There was a sudden dip of the ground, forming a sort of plateau, where a hawthorn-bush, from which the ground had given way, was leaning over the chasm below. Clinging to this bush with desperate energy, I saw a boy of nine years old, unable to regain his footing, and with only the support the frail branch could give him to prevent his falling over into the depths beneath him.</p>

<p>‘ Keep still ! keep quiet !’ I exclaimed ; ‘ do not move ; I am coming.’</p>

<p>But at a glance I took in the extreme peril of the boy’s position and my own. The little bush was half uprooted from the soil, and the ground sloped down to it in a sharp curve. If I missed my footing on the dry slippery turf, I must fall with the boy, over the edge. But there was not a moment to lose. The child called in a fainter voice :</p>

<p>‘ Do come — the thorns prick so ! Do come, please !’</p>

<p>In an instant so much flashed before me, home, Cuthbert, Mr. Hinchcliffe ; and amidst all a voice, almost audible : ‘ He shall give His angels charge over thee.’</p>

<p>My heart went up in a voiceless entreaty. I slipped cautiously down the short but steep descent, and taking hold of the ‘knickerbockered ‘ leg which hung nearest me, I said :</p>

<p>‘ Don’t leave your hold till I tell you to do so.’ Then I succeeded in bringing that foot on the turf, but I doubted if, when the child’s weight was withdrawn from the bush, whether the whole would not rebound and carry us with it down the face of the rock. ‘ Be very quiet, Kapel ‘ — I called him by his name, as I knew it would make more impression — ‘ be very careful, and only move as I tell you. Now, give me one hand ; your leg is firm on the ground, is it not ?’</p>

<p>‘ Yes,’ the boy said ; and then he unclasped one hand from the bough of the hawthorn bush. It was torn and bleeding, pierced with the sharp points of the thorns.</p>

<p>I took it in mine, and pushed myself higher upon the slippery slope. I remember I closed my eyes, and again the voice seemed to sound within me : ‘ Fear not, for I am with thee.’ I knew that all depended on that last desperate pull up the slope. The boy’s weight added to mine was not inconsiderable. If I failed, we must both roll back together — down — down into that deep abyss. I often think of that moment now in my dreams ; I feel myself once more in jeopardy, with Kapel Hinchcliffe’s grandson’s hand in mine. Yes, and I think then and there the moment came of the complete surrender of which Cuthbert had spoken to me : ‘ I am with Thee in life and in death. Lord, I am Thine.’</p>

<p>By God’s great mercy we were in another moment lying together on the short turf, close to the gate, and by that gate stood the boy’s mother, pale, yet calm, and I heard her say :</p>

<p>‘ Kapel, Kapel !’ While the boy replied :</p>

<p>‘ Yes, mother ; it’s all right.’</p>

<p>The words came with difficulty. The poor little fellow had borne all he could endure ; his brown hands were torn and bleeding; his shoulder and arm had suffered in the effort he had made to cling on to the bush and bring one of his legs to the ground, within my reach.</p>

<p>We scrambled to our feet, and Kapel’s mother, breathing heavily, leaned over the gate, and held out her arms to the boy.</p>

<p>‘ That lady saved me, mother. I — I am so sorry I ran away from Bee.’

<p>The gate was not locked, as I had fancied, and by raising it a little from the ground it was soon opened. Mother and son were clasped in a long embrace, and then Mrs. Hinchcliffe turned to me.</p>

<p>‘ How can I thank you ?’</p>

<p>‘ Mother,’ Kapel said, ‘ I saw a funny little brown thing dodging in and out in the wood, and I followed it, and it ran under the gate, and then down that hill. Look, mother, at that round ball ; I thought it was its nest, and I went after it, and the grass was so slippery that I fell and caught hold of that bush, which tipped up — look, mother — and there I hung.’ ‘ I cannot look,’ Mrs. Hinchcliffe said, shuddering. ‘ Oh, Kapel ! you have given me a dreadful fright.’</p>

<p>‘ I am so sorry,’ the boy said. ‘ I was frightened, too — and so were <i>you</i>‘, he added, looking at me.</p>

<p>‘ Yes, indeed,’ I said ; ‘ but now we must bind up your poor little hands and take your mother back to the house.’</p>

<p>‘ If I could find Beatrice we would go home ; the omnibus passes the end of the lane about five o’clock. I often use it when I come out to give lessons to the Miss Lauristons. I would rather not go back to the house.’</p>

<p>‘ You must have some refreshment,’ I said ; ‘ and I am sure you are not fit to walk far. Do lean on my arm, and don’t distress yourself about the boy ; he will soon be all right.’</p>

<p>Poor little Kapel was choking back his tears, and looking very rueful and dejected. We made slow progress towards the house, and it was a relief to meet Bridget and one of the Miss Lauristons. Bridget sprang towards me.</p>

<p>‘ Where have you been, Constantia ? I have been looking for you everywhere. You have missed the tournament on the archery-ground.’ Meantime Miss Lauriston, who was a bright, good-natured-looking girl, was hearing Mrs. Hinchcliffe’s story, and kindly led her back to the Castle, saying she must come and rest in her room before she attempted to go home.</p>

<p>‘ You little monkey !’ she exclaimed, turning to Kapel ; ‘ how could you give your poor mother such a fright ! You will have to be whipped !’</p>

<p>‘ Shall I, though ?’ said Kapel defiantly ; and fiery glances shot from his dark blue eyes, which vividly reminded me of another pair of eyes I knew. Kapel bore a strong family likeness to his grandfather.</p>

<p>‘ I have not told you,’ Mrs. Hinchcliffe said, as we walked slowly towards the Castle, ‘ that this lady has saved my little boy’s life at the risk of her own. I do not know her name.’</p>

<p>‘ I am afraid I don’t, either,’ said Miss Lauriston. ‘ Is she your sister ?’ she asked, turning to Bridget, who was behind us with Kapel.</p>

<p>‘ Yes ; my name is Constantia Carew,’ I said.</p>

<p>‘ How very stupid I am ! but you don’t look like sisters. I knew two Miss Carews were to be here with the Ball-Bakers to-day, but I did not see you when you were introduced. I found your sister out when she was walking with your brother, Mr. Awdry Carew.’</p>

<p>Surely my name was not unfamiliar to Mrs. Hinchcliffe. She grew very pale, and then flushed crimson as she asked :</p>

<p>‘ Do you live in North Devon, near Tessington ?’</p>

<p>‘ Yes,’ I replied ; ‘ my father is the Rector of Cranworth.’</p>

<p>I saw at once that Mrs. Hinchcliffe knew I had some knowledge at least of Hinchcliffe Park and its strange master ; but I could not say or hear more then.</p>

<p>Bridget and I went to join the Ball-Bakers, whom we saw on the terrace, as I felt sure Miss Lauriston preferred taking Mrs. Hinchcliffe alone to her room, with Beatrice, who had now joined her. Kapel went a few steps with his mother, and then came running back.</p>

<p>‘ I shall tell father,’ he said, ‘ what you did for me ; and I’ll never, <i>never</i> forget you.’</p>

<p>I stooped down and kissed the boy’s forehead, being strangely fascinated by him; and so we parted. But I could not let my intercourse with Mrs. Hinchcliffe end here. I took Mimsie into my confidence, and found out her address; and one morning I left the Beeches and its magnificence behind me, and walked over the Downs to Crofton.</p>

<p>The walk was a pleasant one, and I held in my hand a letter from Cuthbert. To ordinary observers that letter might have seemed very much after the pattern of many which had preceded it ; but I, who knew what had passed between us, felt there was a difference. He spoke of his absence for a year, and said he had determined not to see us again. The pain of good-bye was <i>now</i> more than he could well meet. He said he had felt a great deal better of late, and that he almost doubted the wisdom of the doctors in sending him into exile ; but that he knew he could find work anywhere, and as much on board ship or at Madeira and the Cape as in the back-slums of London.</p>

<p>‘ I feel like one,’ he said, ‘ who has much work to do before sun-down, and but little time to do it in.’ He asked me to write to him regularly, and to remember how any small detail of my life had an interest for him. He said he was conscious that he had often been rough and brusque in his words, but in his heart there had never been anything but earnest desire for my happiness.</p>

<p>‘ Oh, I believe it ; I see it now !’ I exclaimed ; ‘ my one friend — my one love.’</p>

<p>There was no future joy to look forward to ; a dim shadow lay between me and a future in which Cuthbert should have a part. And yet, uncertain and intangible as it all looked, there was the present sense of being loved first, and foremost by him, which had a strange sweetness in it for me.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this had come in time to turn the waters of Marah into a pure and healing stream. It was better to be the beloved of a man like Cuthbert, with this uncertainty and indefinite prospect, than to be the wife of the ‘Marmadukes’ and ‘Awdrys’ of the world, even if they had a coronet to bestow.</p>

<p>Cecilia Place was a row of little mean-looking houses, with ‘ apartments ‘ in alternate windows, and low iron balustrades shutting out dusty little gardens from the road. No. 9 had a balcony, and was a little larger than the houses on either side of it.</p>

<p>In this balcony, as I passed and looked up to be sure of the number, I saw a man leaning back in a folding-chair, the newspaper in his hand and a cigar in his mouth. My knock and ring made him leave the paper for a moment, scan my face, decide that I was no concern of his, and resume his former attitude.</p>

<p>A little maid-servant opened the door; she was not untidy or slatternly, but she looked as if she belonged to the tribe of recognised ‘ maid-of-all-work.’</p>

<p>‘ Is Mrs. Hinchcliffe at home ?’ I asked ; and apparently my voice had reached the room on the left of the narrow entry, for a curly head was thrust out, and little Kapel said :</p>

<p>‘ Yes, it <i>is</i> she, mother ; I knew it was ;’ then dashing out, he seized my hand and dragged me into the little dining-room, saying, ‘ I knew you <i>would</i> come.’</p>

<p>I found myself in a room with seven children, of whom Beatrice and Kapel were the eldest, and a baby in a cradle the youngest. At the end of the table, which was nearly as long as the room, sat the mother, a pile of work before her, and a book from which she was giving Beatrice and Kapel a lesson in geography when I interrupted them.</p>

<p>The four little heads were all turned from the contemplation of a large atlas, much fingered and torn, when I entered, and four pairs of large blue eyes, deep as violets with the dew upon them, gazed at me. Beatrice, the little mother of the younger ones, rose at once, and put a chair for me, while Mrs. Hinchcliffe said :</p>

<p>‘Clear away the books, dear Bee, and take the children into the Square. Then,’ she added, with a smile, ‘ I can talk to you.’</p>

<p>Kapel’s hands were still tied up with rags, and as he walked out of the room with Beatrice, the four little ones toddling behind, he looked back at me as if he longed to stay, but he never questioned his mother’s will.</p>

<p>We heard the children’s little feet climbing the narrow stairs to get their hats and jackets, and then Mrs. Hinchcliffe said with a sigh :</p>

<p>‘Dear little things, I do not think I could spare one of them, and yet sometimes it is a heavy burden.’</p>

<p>‘ I am sure it must be,’ I said, ‘ and you are so far from strong.’</p>

<p>‘ That is the worst part of it. I am beginning to be afraid I must give up all distant lessons. I would have my pupils here, but the piano disturbs my husband. You know it is so terribly hard for him to be confined in a little close house like this. It is quite different for me ; I was never accustomed to luxury and grandeur. My father was a professional man — an organist in a cathedral town — Crayminster — and he gave lessons on the piano and singing. He had a large family, and I was the eldest; but I ought not to trouble you with all these things. I wanted to ask you a question — did you ever hear anything of Mr. Hinchcliffe, my husband’s father ?’</p>

<p>The colour rushed to my face.</p>

<p>‘ Yes,’ I said ; ‘ I know him very well.’</p>

<p>‘ Has he ever mentioned Guy to you ?’</p>

<p>Again I was obliged to answer ‘ Yes.’</p>

<p>‘ He is very hard and unforgiving,’ she said ; ‘ and the sad part of it is, that marrying <i>me</i> is the unpardonable offence. Before Guy knew me, everything was forgiven ; now I am afraid forgiveness is hopeless.’</p>

<p>‘ There is always hope,’ I said, ‘ while life lasts.’</p>

<p>‘ Guy was wrong, I know, and often offended his father ; but now, with so many depending on him, it is dreadful to see him cast off and turned out of his home. I do all I can, and I have had a great many pupils through the Miss Lauristons’ recommendation ; but I am getting so weak, I can’t walk as I once did.’</p>

<p>‘ I am sure you cannot go on like this,’ I said vehemently ; ‘ it is impossible !’</p>

<p>‘ You see/ Mrs. Hinchcliffe said, ‘ if we were sure that Guy’s father would allow him to have part of his fortune, at least when he died, there would be <i>some</i> prospect for the future. But a rumour has got afloat that Mr. Hinchcliffe has made his will in favour of some one else. Have you heard it ?’</p>

<p>Again I felt myself blushing crimson as I answered, ‘ Yes.’</p>

<p>‘ It is so unjust,’ Mrs. Hinchcliffe said. ‘ I know when we were in great difficulties, six years ago, Mr. Hinchcliffe offered to pay Guy’s debts if he would consent to make a compromise. We were in great straits then ; I was ill, and could do nothing to help, so it was arranged through the lawyers ; but we never thought Mr. Hinchcliffe would really be so hard, especially when he knows there are seven little children.’</p>

<p>She stooped as she spoke and raised the baby from the cradle. He was awake, but he did not cry ; it was the happy awakening of a healthy child.</p>

<p>‘ Is he not a darling ?’ his mother said.</p>

<p>I was no baby-lover in those days : babies were to me a ‘ sealed book,’ which I never cared to open — little lumps of humanity, which were of no interest while the soul lay dormant ; but little Leonardo was decidedly a child of a superior order.</p>

<p>But the beauty of the mother, as she clasped him in her arms, was what struck me most. That sweet Madonna-like light, which can only shine in the faces of true mothers, shone in Beatrice Hinchcliffe’s. I have seen many lovely women, whose faces have wanted this chief attraction ; indifferent mothers, whose children are less to them than their dogs, or at any rate stand on the same level with them ; mothers who think only of the external part, and leave their children to nurses, and governesses, and school teachers.</p>

<p> <i>What</i> do they not miss? The very crown and glory of womanhood is wilfully set aside by such women, and they have no chord to strike in harmony with that meek and gentle Mother of the sinless Son who, even in the days of His childhood, was supreme in His earthly affection and love — a love which was strong in death, as He commended her to His beloved disciple as a precious legacy from the Cross ?</p>

<p>Open the eyes of the self-seeking, indifferent, and careless mothers of the little children given them by God ! Open their eyes, that they may see, and taste for themselves a joy which no pleasures of literature or art, of tasteful dress and acknowledged beauty, can ever give them !</p>

<p>As Beatrice Hinchcliffe clasped her boy in her arms I felt, I think for the first time, the full extent of Mr. Hinchcliffe’s cruelty towards her; and I determined I would brave all consequences, and tell him, on my return to Cranworth, what I had seen, and appeal to him for help for his daughter-in-law. As if reading my thoughts, Mrs. Hinchcliffe said :</p>

<p>‘ I know Mr. Hinchcliffe says very, very hard things about me ; I don’t think I deserve them ! If I was wrong to marry Guy, I did it when I was very young, and my father wished me to do so. Guy’s name and rank were a temptation to him, not to me ; oh, not to me ! I loved him for himself alone ; he knows I did.’</p>

<p>There was a mixture of dignity and simplicity in Mrs. Hinchcliffe which I never saw equalled as she went on with her story.</p>

<p>‘ It is so long since I have talked to a friend,’ she said ; ‘ and you, who saved my boy’s life, must be a friend, though we never met till the other day. Little did I think when I went to that grand garden-party — because I like my children sometimes to see people who are some what above those who surround us here — little did I think I should meet you ; and now we must always be bound together henceforth. You saved Kapel, and Kapel’s mother must always love you.’</p>

<p>Every word seemed to strike me with a fresh pain — addressed to me so innocently, standing, as I knew I did, between these children and their rights.</p>

<p>And now the door opened, and Guy Hinchcliffe himself came in. How tall and majestic he looked as he stood in that little mean room, his head almost touching the ceiling, where the gaudy gasalier, with its yellow-gauze covering, had left a black mark from the burners.</p>

<p>Guy Hinchcliffe bowed stiffly to me ; and I saw at a glance that he was the master and lord of that gentle graciouswoman,who looked timidly up at him and said :</p>

<p>‘ This is Miss Carew, Guy ; the lady who was so brave, and saved our little Kapel’s life at Croft Castle.’</p>

<p>‘ The little monkey is always in mischief,’ was the rejoinder, for it could hardly be called an answer. ‘ He will not easily forget this, I think, for he has sprained his leg, and torn his hands with the thorns. It was very good of you,’ he went on, ‘ to trouble yourself about him, I am sure. Have you any letters for the post, Beatrice ?’</p>

<p>‘ No, thanks,’ was said in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘ I am going over to Cheltenham for an hour or two.’ And then, with another bow to me, Guy Hinchcliffe was leaving the room, when suddenly he turned back. ‘You know North Devon, Miss Carew, I believe ; so do I. Cranworth is very near Hinchcliffe Park, where my old father lives, or exists ; he is as mad as a March hare, as, if you are his neighbour, I have no doubt you have found out ;’ then, with a bitter mocking laugh, he was gone.</p>

<p>‘ He was not always like that,’ his wife said. ‘ Oh ! if he would only ‘ she stopped ; so true a wife could not complain of her husband !</p>

<p>‘ You must need patience, I am sure,’ I said.</p>

<p>‘ I pray for it every hour,’ was the low reply ; ‘ and for <i>him</i> — my poor dear Guy !’

<p>‘ I must go back to The Beeches now,’ I said. ‘ I shall be late for luncheon, as it is. Will you be coming to give Mimsie a lesson before I leave Crofton, do you think ? I want so much to hear you play.’</p>

<p>She sprang up at once.</p>

<p>‘ Guy is gone out ; I will play to you now if you will take Baby.’</p>

<p>‘ He will cry !’ I exclaimed ; ‘ and — and I don’t know how to hold him !’</p>

<p>‘Sit down,’ she said, ‘ and I will put him on your lap ; and he will be quite good the moment I begin to play. It is only a very old piano, but it answers my purpose, as I cannot use it much. I get into the church sometimes — Mr. Watson is the rector — and then I play the organ. Ah, that is bliss ! though it does not roll out in that church as it did at Crayminster, in my beloved cathedral.’</p>

<p>And then she struck a few chords, and then played a certain Andante of Beethoven’s, which spoke to my very soul. Then she seemed to forget everything around her, and played an impromptu of her own. The baby, who had frightened me at first by struggling a little, fulfilled his mother’s prophecy and subsided. Only a low cooing sound escaped him ; and when now and then he threw his head back to examine me, he looked surprised and scared.</p>

<p>‘ Ah, thank you !’ I said. ‘ This is a wonderful day in my calendar ; for I never held a baby of ten months on my knee before.’</p>

<p>‘ Then you did not know how sweet it is, did you ?’ she replied. ‘ Must you really go ?’</p>

<p>‘ Indeed I must ; but I hope we shall meet again ;’ and so we parted.</p>

<p>In the Square I met the children ; Kapel leading one little sister, Beatrice another, and the others rolling their hoops. Beatrice and Kapel were quite the elderly ones of the flock of children. Kapel came up to me at once.</p>

<p>‘ I am glad you came to see mother !’ he exclaimed ; ‘ she wanted you ever so much to come.’</p>

<p>Beatrice, quiet and motherly, stood by, and let Kapel have all the conversation.</p>

<p>‘ Tell me the names of the four little sisters ?’ I said, addressing her.</p>

<p>‘Violet, Maude, Cara, and little Tessa,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>‘ What pretty names !’ I rejoined ; ‘ and you are Beatrice.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes ; they call me Bee generally, except father : he likes me to be called Beatrix — spelt with an <i>x</i>, you know. And <i>did</i> you see our baby — little Leonardo ? Is he not lovely ?’</p>

<p>I had a stiff manner with children in those days : I was conscious of it, and this very consciousness did not help me to improve. The beauty of babies was not a subject to which I had given much thought : but we live to learn ; and I think in my later life I have atoned for this want of taste !</p>

<p>I was very late for luncheon ; and Mrs. Ball- Baker was surprised to hear I had been to see Mimsie’s music-mistress.</p>

<p>‘ I am sure it was very good-natured of you, my dear. When is she coming to give Mimsie her lesson ?’</p>

<p>‘Not this week, I am afraid,’ I answered. Mrs. Hinchcliffe is really not strong enough to walk as far.’</p>

<p>‘ But there’s the ‘bus, which puts her down at the end of the lane, and very convenient it is.’</p>

<p>‘The omnibus jolts fearfully, mamma,’ said little Mimsie. ‘ I had a headache all day after it, when I came with nurse from Crofton.’</p>

<p>‘ You, my precious ! yes, a little delicate thing like you. Nurse had no business to put you in a ‘bus at all.’</p>

<p>The next few days were taken up with various phases of excitement and gaiety. A large dinner-party at The Beeches was one, when the table groaned under the weight of plate, and the guests were resplendent in every shade of colour.</p>

<p>‘ Such a dinner-table is not often looked down upon by any hostess, and that’s the truth.’ Mrs. Ball-Baker said this afterwards, with an honest, simple expression of satisfaction which was rather attractive. Downright vulgarity is far easier to tolerate than masked vulgarity. Some people who make a great show and pretence of good manners, remind me always of plated forks. The silvering is sure to wear off in places ; and the real material shows out. Society, at its best, is a great puzzle.’</p>

<p>I was taken in to dinner by a leading physi cian of the neighbourhood, who had the care of Mimsie’s little frail person, and whose fees must have been unlimited. He talked to me at first, but his neighbour on the other side had more attractions for him. She was acknowleged to be one of the <i>élite</i> of Crofton, and fully carried out her character. She spoke in a low monotone, and wore a perpetual smile. When introduced to me she pressed my hand, and looked intensely interested in hearing that I was Miss Carew.</p>

<p>Depending on this cordiality, I crossed the drawing-room after dinner, and took a seat by Mrs. Ravenswood. But an old dowager with a large head-dress of feathers and a diamond star now engrossed Mrs. Ravenswood’s attention. She looked at me blandly without uttering a word, and then tried to keep up a low conversation with old Lady Bertram, who was very drowsy after her dinner, but she was a real live countess, and as such was the glory and joy of Crofton society.</p>

<p>Lady Bertram loved pomp and show, and delighted in good dinners, to which she did full justice, and in return honoured such people as the Ball-Bakers by asking them to weak tea and bread and butter. Still, she was worth cultivating, for it is not everyone who can entertain the widow of an Earl !</p>

<p>As the gentlemen came in from the dining-room I saw Marmaduke Headlam go straight up to Bridget and lean over her chair. Almost simultaneously Julia came to me.</p>

<p>‘ Things are going on prosperously in that direction,’ she said ; ‘ Bridget seems as happy as poor Duke ! I am not jealous ; I should not dream of marrying my cousin, nor indeed of marrying at all, till I am too elderly to do anything else. Don’t look so shocked. The only fault I have with you is that you are so good and proper.’</p>

<p>‘ There is nothing serious,’ I said. ‘ I mean, you don’t think Mr. Headlam is really in love with Bridget? ‘</p>

<p>‘ I am sure of it, and so is she ; but take care, Mrs. Ravenswood is pricking up her ears. I can’t endure that little woman ; she gives herself such airs, and of course has no reason to do so. Her father was a leading lawyer in Boxton, and she has married a very wealthy banker; and you would think she was the Duchess of Sutherland, at least ! What a farce the world is ! I am often sick of it — aren’t you ?’</p>

<p>‘ I have seen so little of it,’ I said ; ‘ but if Crofton is a type of the world, I certainly am not much enchanted. I prefer our moors, and the few people we know there.’</p>

<p>‘ Parsons and their families, I suppose,’ Julia said ; ‘ but they must be very dull.’

<p>‘ Not duller than— ‘</p>

<p>I stopped, but Julia finished the sentence for me :</p>

<p>‘ Than ironmasters and their wives. I am sure you are right. Here comes your brother.’</p>

<p>Awdry came to ask Julia to play, which she did at once, and rattled off a piece called ‘ La Pluie des Perles’ in grand style. Mrs. Hinchcliffe’s Andante on the little cottage piano was music, and <i>this</i> — was noise ; but it was much applauded, and Julia was asked to play something else. There is a difference of taste, happily, even in music !</p>

<hr> <!--running (side) header is "Sept., 1862"-->

<p>When Bridget and I were in our room together that night, all doubts as to the truth of Julia’s suspicion was set at rest ; Marmaduke Headlam had proposed to Bridget, and she had accepted him.</p>

<p>It was our first experience of anything of the kind in our family, and Bridget was pleased to be the first to introduce the fashion.</p>

<p>‘ Do you care for Mr. Headlam, Bridget?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; and he is so good-tempered, Constantia, and so well-off.’

<p>‘ I think there is something else to look for beyond good-temper and money.’</p>

<p>‘ You mean birth. Well, Mr. Headlam’s father was a corn-merchant ; but I don’t see that signifies in the least.’</p>

<p>‘I was not thinking of social matters at all, Bridget ; I was thinking of life with Mr. Headlam. Won’t it be rather dull and heavy ? and there are higher aims than earthly ones.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes,’ Bridget said, rather sadly ; ‘ I know that ; and sometimes I have thought, Constantia, that we all have missed the real meaning of religion. It isn’t only going to church, and reading the Bible, and saying our prayers. It is something more. But I think <i>he</i> is really good, and he says he will do all he can for Awdry. He has already got him out of one scrape here. Do kiss me, Constantia, and be glad.’</p>

<p>‘ You cannot settle it,’ I said, ‘ till papa knows ; he must be consulted.’</p>

<p>Then I put my arms round my sister and drew her towards me. She laid her head, sobbing, on my shoulder, and I heard her whisper :</p>

<p>‘ I wish to do right ; indeed I do.’</p>

<p>Mr. Headlam wrote to my father the next day, and Bridget enclosed a little note. The day after, was the one fixed for our return.</p>

<p>I managed to get to Cecilia Place once more, but it was not a very satisfactory visit. The baby was cross with his teeth, Cara and Tessa were quarrelling over a headless doll, and the little dining-room seemed full to overflowing with children.</p>

<p>In the midst of the uproar a loud resonant voice called from the head of the staircase :</p>

<p>‘ Keep those children quiet, or I’ll come down and whip them all round !’</p>

<p>It was Guy Hinchcliffe’s voice, and I saw his wife’s cheeks grow pale as she said :</p>

<p>‘ Guy has a headache to-day, and the children have not been as good as usual. Nothing annoys Guy so much as to hear the children crying. Oh, Tessa, my darling, do be a good child !’</p>

<p>‘ Does your husband do nothing to help you ?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘What should he do ?’ Mrs. Hinchcliffe asked; ‘ he has been brought up so differently from young men who have to work for their living.’</p>

<p>‘ Does Kapel go to school ?’</p>

<p>‘ He did for a little while after we first came to Crofton, but we could not pay the bills ; so I took him away. Ah, there are dark days when I long to lie down quietly, and shut my eyes on it all for ever ; but <i>then</i> there are the children ! Miss Carew,’ she went on, ‘if I have to leave them will <i>you</i> befriend them — will you some times think about them, especially about my Kapel ? He has the strong will of the family, and nothing but love and kindness has any effect on him.’</p>

<p>‘ If it ever lies in my power to do anything for your children,’ I replied, ‘ I will do it.’</p>

<p>As I spoke I felt how much <i>might</i> lie in my power ; and I was oppressed with the knowledge. We parted as old friends part, rather than acquaintances of yesterday, and I thought my visit to Crofton, like Bridget’s, had not been in vain.</p>

<hr> <!--Extra space in between paragraphs.-->

<p>Mrs. Ball-Baker was delighted with the prospect of an engagement between Duke and Bridget. ‘ Such a pretty, ladylike girl she is, and I am sure she will make a good wife. Your papa won’t raise any objections, I hope.’</p>

<p>I was not very sure how that might be. My dear father, like many other people, was more tenacious of his dignity as the bearer of an old name than he was aware of.</p>

<p>Marmaduke Headlam, with his uneasy manner, his perpetual smoothing of his too smooth hair, his elaborate ties, and large ring, was not precisely the son-in-law I could imagine my father and * the Lady Serena ‘ delighting in. But then there was the other side of the picture ; we were poor, and if anything happened to our father we must leave our peaceful moorland home and live on a very small income. Awdry had been a great burden, my Australian brother had needed help again and again, and Charlie was often very glad to have assistance. He had his captaincy now, and things were improving with him ; he wrote of ‘ leave,’ and seeing us all again in a year or two, and we began to look forward to the return of our soldier with pleasure. Still, my father’s sons had been expensive sons, and altogether we were not gifted with economical talents.</p>

<p>I had thought often while staying at The Beeches how very much more, in the midst of all the magnificence and grandeur, <i>small</i> expenses were thought of ; for instance, an extra stamp on a letter — the loss of a glove — the anxiety to give a boy who had opened a gate for us in the country, when Julia was driving us in her beautiful pony-carriage, a threepenny bit instead of sixpence.</p>

<p>My father would not have thought twice about it, but would have tossed the boy sixpence with some pleasant remark, while Julia deplored the necessity of parting with her sixpence again and again !</p>

<p>It was the same with Mrs. Hinchcliffe’s music lessons. I heard Mrs. Ball-Baker calculating how many Mimsie had missed, and how much must be deducted from the bill. ‘ Alas !’ I thought, ‘for Mrs. Hinchcliffe, literally working for her children’s daily bread.’</p>

<p>Mimsie had taken a very decided affection for me, and had wrinkled up her face with crying the last night I went to kiss her in her bed.</p>

<p>‘Would you like to come to the Rectory, Mimsie ?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘ Oh, I should <i>love</i> it !’ the poor little thing exclaimed. ‘ <i>Will</i> you invite me, really ?’</p>

<p>‘ We will see about it. I must ask your mamma’s leave.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Ball-Baker received my proposition doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘ She is a tender plant,’ she exclaimed ; ‘ but she has taken such a fancy to you, I don’t know how to refuse it. I must ask her papa.’</p>

<p>Mimsie was obliged to rest satisfied with this, and my last sight of her little wobegone face at a closed window, as we drove off, reminded me more than ever of the caged bird.</p>

<p>‘ If she does not have more air and exercise she will die,’ I said ; and Julia, who came to see the last of us at Boxton, quite agreed with me.</p>

<p>Duke and Awdry were at the station. We had no reason to complain of not being well attended now. Duke brought a bouquet as large as his head for his lady-love, and a little note screwed up in it seemed to afford Bridget much pleasure as we travelled homewards.</p>

<p>Home-going was always pleasant. I was looking forward to the sight of the familiar objects : the tors, with their fantastic outlines ; the great mass of firs, which shut in Hinchcliffe Park; my own room, with its peaceful atmosphere, and the old pear-tree, now bending, as I pictured it, under its burden of heavy fruit; the avenue along which I had so often seen the tall figure of Mr. Hinchcliffe on his way to the Rectory.</p>

<p>We were left at the Junction with our boxes to wait for the Cranworth train, which never hurried itself; and there were only two other passengers besides ourselves.</p>

<p>‘ Papa will be tired of waiting,’ Bridget said, ‘ and will be getting into one of his fumes. What do you think he will say about Duke’s letter, Constantia ?’</p>

<p>‘ That remains to be seen. You must take it quietly, Bridget ; and of course nothing can be settled till papa has seen Mr. Headlam.’</p>

<p>‘ Some people think Duke rather like Awdry,’ Bridget went on, after a pause, during which she was no doubt calling up the image of Marmaduke, and considering what impression he would make.</p>

<p>‘ Like Awdry !’ I exclaimed. ‘ You had better not say that to mamma. But good looks are not everything, and I am sure we have proved the truth of this in Awdry’s case.’</p>

<p>‘ That is <i>one</i> reason I like — I mean I care for Duke,’ Bridget said ; ‘ he has been so kind to Awdry, and he really is improved. He does go to the office every day in better time ; and, do you know, Duke paid some money for him ; and he makes nothing of it, and is really so good and kind. I wish you liked him, Constantia.’</p>

<p>‘ My dear child, I like him well enough ; and he has not asked <i>me</i> to marry him, you know.’</p>

<p>‘ He is afraid of you, Constantia ; he thinks you make fun of him, and that you are so clever.’</p>

<p>The half-apologetic tone in which Bridget spoke made me laugh ; and she caught the infection, and laughed too, saying :</p>

<p>‘ I shall be glad when it is over, and I have seen papa, for I do dread it. Here comes the train.’</p>

<p>The little engine came puffing up, with three nearly empty carriages behind it.</p>

<p>An old woman with a basket and a man who looked like an artist, who had been a sketching tour on the moors, were the only passengers. The guard escorted Bridget and me to our carriage, and seemed to pay us unusual attention. I thought there was something passing between him and the superintendent, who came out of his little box of an office, and exchanged a few words with the guard. I caught the word ‘ telegram,’ and ‘ better not ;’ and then, to make up for lost time, we were soon off on the short journey from the Junction to Tessington.</p>

<p>We were all ready to get out of our carriage ; and expected to see the well-known figure of our father, to hear his cheery ‘ Well, here you are ; now about your luggage ‘ — but no one was on the platform. Through the tall white palings which separated the little station from the road I saw a crowd — that is, some dozen people — collected.</p>

<p>‘ How odd it is no one is here ; and our train is late. Here comes a porter !’ Bridget exclaimed.</p>

<p>The porter knew us well, and touched his hat.</p>

<p>‘ Is the carriage here from Cranworth Rectory?’ I asked.</p>

<p>But the porter only replied by taking my bag from my hand, and going down the line to the luggage-van. Then as we waited I saw some heads peeping at us over the railings, and a man — Roger Parsons — came through the door of the-booking office. His face was very pale, and he spoke in a strange hurried way.</p>

<p>‘ I have sent for a fly from the Hinchcliffe Arms, ma’am,’ he said ; ‘ it will be here directly.’</p>

<p>‘ Where is Mr. Carew ? Did he not come to meet us with the carriage ?’ I asked. And now a chill sense of fear seemed to shadow me. ‘ Is there anything wrong ?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘ Yes, ma’am ; there has been an accident. Please not to go this way.’ ‘An accident!’ Bridget exclaimed; ‘what accident ?’</p>

<p>‘ Well, to the carriage, miss, and it’s smashed to pieces ; and —’ Roger Parsons laid his hand on my arm as I attempted to pass him. ‘ The Rector was thrown out, and — and we have carried him in there — to the waiting-room. You had better not go in — you must not go in, Miss Carew. The stationmaster telegraphed for Dr. Moore, who is gone to Exeter to-day : they have got Mr. Blackley, who was passing at the time.’</p>

<p>I remember all that passed now ; I can see everything as if in a mirror before me. At the time I was unconscious of details, or that I was actually receiving impressions which would be with me henceforth as living realities. I walked mechanically past Roger Parsons, pushing aside with my hand another man who would have prevented me ; and the next moment I was face to face with the first great and overwhelming sorrow of my life. On the hard leather-covered bench of the little bare waiting- room lay my father — dead.</p>

<p>‘ It must have been instantaneous !’ some one said. ‘ He could not have suffered ;’ and, indeed, there was no trace of suffering.</p>

<p>My father lay with a calm, peaceful expression on his face ; a dark mark just above the eye was the only visible sign of what had happened. I looked round on the group of kind people, some with tears running down their cheeks, others standing like statues, awe-struck, silent.</p>

<p>‘ <i>How</i> did it happen?’ I asked, my voice sounding like some one’s else, not my own at all.</p>

<p>‘ It was Jess, the pony, Miss Carew,’ said Roger Parsons ; ‘ I saw it all. The poor gentle man had a tussle with her at the corner of Stag Lane. She tore off when he had made her turn the corner like a mad thing, and just knocked the carriage to pieces by the wall yonder. The Rector was pitched out on the heap of stones they had piled up for mending the road, and never moved again.’</p>

<p>‘ How long ago ?’</p>

<p>‘ Not twenty minutes,’ Miss Carew.</p>

<p>‘ Papa — papa ! Oh, father !’</p>

<p>It was Bridget’s voice. Then, with a cry, she threw herself down on her knees by the bench. The large bouquet fell from her hands and lay on the floor ; again and again her voice tried to reach our father where he was gone. ‘ Father — father !’ she cried ; but I was mute. Next came the consciousness that Bridget and I knew what my mother and Rose did not know ; and they must be told, and <i>I</i> must tell them.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackley, a doctor from a neighbouring village, was very kind ; but I saw, though he still held one of my father’s hands in his, he attempted no means to restore him. There was nothing to be done.</p>

<p>‘ We have sent for a fly, Miss Carew,’ he said ; I had you not better drive home with your sister?’</p>

<p>Then there was a stir outside the station, and the little group fell back, as a tall figure I knew well walked up to the sofa. Mr. Hinchcliffe did not at first see me ; at any rate, he did not notice me or Bridget, who was still kneeling by all that was left us of our father.</p>

<p>‘ Telegraph for a London doctor,’ he said, in a peremptory voice. ‘ Now, sir, turning to Mr. Blackley, ‘do it at once. What is the use of delay ? Will you do as I bid you ? Telegraph for Sir William Gull, or— ‘</p>

<p>‘ It is useless, sir,’ Mr. Blackley said in a low voice ; ‘ perfectly useless.’</p>

<p>‘ Then it is a hard and cruel fate,’ was the reply, spoken in a ringing voice. ‘ Where is Moore ? he is a man of sense. Where is Moore ?’</p>

<p>‘ Mr. Moore is away to-day in Exeter ; but we have telegraphed for him.’</p>

<p>And now Mr. Hinchcliffe seemed to think of Bridget, who moaned and cried at his feet :</p>

<p>‘ Father— father !’</p>

<p>So filled was he with the awful story which had been told him as he was passing on horseback, that he had really not noticed us at first. Then from Bridget he turned quickly and saw me.</p>

<p>‘ My child — my dear child !’ he exclaimed, ‘ you must come away !’</p>

<p>He tried to draw my hand through his arm, but I freed myself, and went to Bridget, putting my arm round her, and saying :</p>

<p>‘ We must go home to poor mother, Bridget.’</p>

<p>‘ Yes — yes ; and Rose. Oh, poor Rose !’</p>

<p>‘ Even in grief like this she turns from me,’ I heard Mr. Hinchcliffe say in a low voice.</p>

<p>But nothing I heard seemed to move me. I <i>could</i> not, as it were, awake to the full sense of what had happened ; I felt much more as if it were all a horrible dream, and that I must soon wake and find it to be a dream.</p>

<p>Bridget rose and threw herself into my arms, and so we prepared to go home. What a homecoming it was ! Only half an hour before and I was filled with the sense of its sweetness, and longing for it as I had never longed before. Now, with one electric touch, all was taken from me for ever. Cranworth Rectory could never be home again ! There are, I know, many religious people who speak of their experiences in crushing and sudden sorrows like ours, as very distinct and clearly defined. I have read of such many a time : of the certainty of God’s presence in it — of the words which have arisen as a message from above to comfort and support — of the blessedness of affliction in bringing the soul near to God.</p>

<p>It may be so — it <i>is</i> so, I do not doubt ; but I cannot say it was then what I felt. I could not rise out of the deadening influence of the blow. I could not pray, if by prayer is understood many words ; I could do nothing but fall on my face, as it were, and endure. He, the most compassionate and loving One, laid His hand upon me at last ; and I arose and went on my way strengthened, and in a measure healed, but not at first. It was all a dull dreamy sense of pain, such as is felt when under the partial influence of chloroform or ether.</p>

<p>We were put in the fly, Bridget and I, and jogged slowly along up the familiar road. As we came to the turn, where I had often waited for Cuthbert, where the footpath branches oft” over the moor, I saw that Mr. Hinchcliffe was riding near us. It was a silent expression of sympathy which touched me.</p>

<p>We reached the fir-tree avenue, across which the glowing September sunshine was lying in golden bars. We turned the sweep by the willow, and the creaking of the heavy wheels brought Rose to the door.</p>

<p>‘ I thought it was the pony-carriage,’ she said. ‘ Where’s papa ?’</p>

<p>I held up my hand to warn her, I was so afraid that my mother should hear the news suddenly. Rose’s pretty face grew pale — a reflection, no doubt, of mine.</p>

<p>‘ Constantia, how ill you look ! what is the matter ?’</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliffe, sitting like a horseman carved in marble, or cast in iron, watching us.</p>

<p>‘ Bridget, why do you cry ? Oh, Bridget !’</p>

<p>‘ Hush, Rose !’ I entreated ; ‘ try to be quiet ;’ and then I passed into the hall.</p>

<p>The drawing-room door was partly open, and I saw my mother in her accustomed place, leaning back in her chair, with some needlework in her hand. Never did she look more like ‘my Lady Serena.’</p>

<p>I went quietly in, and she looked up.</p>

<p>‘ Constantia ! was the train late ? Where is Bridget ? Did your papa keep you waiting, or did you keep him ?’</p>

<p>My face must have told its own tale, for my mother started up, and came towards me where I stood.</p>

<p>‘ Dear mother,’ I said, ‘ there has been an accident.’</p>

<p>‘ Bridget ?’</p>

<p>‘ No ; my father.’</p>

<p>‘ Your <i>father</i> ? Let me go to him. Your father ?’ as if unable to grasp my meaning.</p>

<p>‘ You must not go ; you cannot go to him, dear mother.’</p>

<p>‘ You don’t mean he is —’</p>

<p>The word could find no utterance; but I supplied it :</p>

<p> <i>‘ Yes</i> ; he is dead.’</p>

<p>I could not soften the heavy news ; I could not break it. How do we ever break ill news ?</p>

<p>My poor mother gave one low cry, and fell senseless at my feet. Her prop and stay was gone ; she was from that hour like a clinging plant which has trusted for support to some stalwart elm or oak, and when it is cut down collapses utterly.</p>

<p>Natures like my mother’s do not show any very startling change nor striking alteration when the storms sweep over them, but they are withered by the blast, and are never the same again. There is not the power of rebound in them which more impulsive and ardent natures know. They are serene still, but it is the serenity of sadness and hopelessness, while before it was the serenity of contentment and peace.</p>

<p>I need not go through here all the details of that time of trouble. Too many who read my story can fill them in from personal experience. The prominent feeling in my mind has, I doubt not, been shared by many daughters who have seen their father taken from them. I had not loved him half enough ; rather, I had not given him half enough the signs of the affection which had been in me.</p>

<p>And how we missed him ! He was the pervading element of our lives. Death, now it had come, as the snow comes and covers the rugged earth, smoothing all inequalities and softening every outline, showed us how great was our loss. And not ours only ; the parish and neighbourhood mourned him as a genial sympathetic friend is mourned.</p>

<p>I have said that as a family we did not throw ourselves into the concerns of our poor neighbours and parishioners as many have done and do. But this remark applied to me and my mother and sisters, and not to my father. When he was gone, we heard from the outside world — the little world around us — how many were his deeds of kindness, how great his benevolence.</p>

<p>He had left his Bible open on his desk, when he went to meet us at Tessington. A note for his Sunday sermon, with the list of hymns, lay on the page. When I went to prepare the room to receive all that was mortal of its late master, I saw the table precisely as he had left it. Marmaduke Headlam’s letter lay there, and poor Bridget’s little note, a letter closely written from my brother in India, and some on more trifling business matters. But the Bible had an especial message. It was by a strange foreshadowing open at the Psalms, and the Psalm marked for the sermon was the ninetieth : ‘ Thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.’ The notes of this began with : ‘ Life here, fading and transitory ; Life in Christ, eternal and ever new ; Life without Him is impossible, for He <i>is</i> our Life, and when —’</p>

<p>That was all. I cherish the little slip of paper amongst my most precious possessions, and it came to me as a voice of comfort and a ray of sunlight in my dark hours.</p>

<p>Neighbours and friends from the village and the country near us, all gathered round on the sad day when we laid our father to rest in the little churchyard. <i>One</i> there was who broke the spell of years and stood in the church which he had never entered in the Rector’s lifetime, to show his affection and respect for him who was gone from us.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the solemnity of the scene I could detach myself from the prominent and all-engrossing thoughts which pressed on me, to notice how erect that stately figure stood ; the strong lines of suppressed emotion on his face as the majestic words of St. Paul fell on his ear for the first time, perhaps, for many years : ‘ So also is the resurrection of the dead.’ There are times when unbelief in the great doctrines of our Redemption is impossible. I think at my father’s open grave Kapel Hinchcliffe bowed beneath the Hand, against which he had so often rebelled.</p>

<p>When the day which separates us from all contact with our beloved ones is over, when life must begin again with all its accustomed routine, and, as in our case, with a great addition of cares and anxieties, the hardest part of our sorrow lies before us. The great trouble which for a week has been alone present and thought of is, by the very nature of things, thrust back by the lesser worries and vexations which an entire change of circumstances brings in its train.</p>

<p>‘ What shall we do ? where shall we go ?’ became the great and anxious question of those whose home has been dependent on the life of the husband and father, and who must now seek another.</p>

<p>Of course Awdry had been summoned, and a nephew of Sir Roland Awdry’s came to represent him at the funeral. Then there were one or two distant relations on my father’s side, and the family lawyer, who read the will to us — a very short and simple will, direct and straight forward, as everything my father said or did was direct.</p>

<p>The living was in the gift of Sir Roland Awdry, who gave it to the curate of a church in Exeter, who was engaged to the daughter of his surgeon, and was delighted to step into it.</p>

<p>It was a good piece of preferment for so young a man, and he thought so. He came over to see the house, and brought with him his mother-in-law to be, and his lady-love. It fell to me to take them over the house and grounds, and they showed a lamentable want of that great necessity in all social dealings — tact and consideration for my feelings.</p>

<p>‘ You don’t keep any horses then, Miss Carew,’ was one remark as we passed the empty stable.</p>

<p>Poor Jess, whose wilful obstinacy had wrought so much trouble, had never returned to Cranworth after that day. The same thoughtful care which was silently extended to us in many things, was seen here. Mr. Hinchcliffe had ordered Jess to be taken to his bailiff’s, and there I believe she ended her days in a cart. I never saw her again.</p>

<p>A warning look from Mr. Passmore (our young successor) had failed in its intention.</p>

<p>‘ Well, I should have thought in this out-of-the-way place you would be obliged to keep a carriage ; but perhaps you did not visit much in the neighbourhood.’</p>

<p> <i>‘ Mamma</i> !’ from the little gentle daughter had some effect in stopping this, and I caught a whispered remark : ‘ You know it was a carriage accident.’</p>

<p>There are some people who are born blind or deaf, or with some bodily deficiency. We pity them, and do not think the less of them on this account. Perhaps we should show equal forbearance for those who are born without ‘ tact,’ or, in plainer language, without consideration for the feelings of others. Of course there are ways of supplying bodily deficiencies by artificial means, and there are means of cultivating what may pass for the native refinement and courteous regard for others which is so sweet, especially in times of adversity. But I am inclined to think nothing is more difficult to acquire, and that people of blunt sensibilities have no idea how they wound finer ones ; thus they do not take the trouble to cultivate a quality of which they are wholly ignorant, and their eyes can neither see that their words hurt, or <i>why</i> they hurt, those who are inwardly writhing under them in positive torture.</p>

<p>I had with many other pressing matters the weight of Bridget’s love-affair upon me. I did not feel sure that she cared enough for Marmaduke Headlam to marry him, and Rose was certain she did not.</p>

<p>I reminded her of what she had said when we arrived at The Beeches, that it would be ‘ nice to be naturally rich, and not rich by trade.’ And though Marmaduke could offer Bridget a very comfortable home, and, by comparison, he might be called rich, I did not think that she would find life with him what she imagined. Marmaduke behaved very well ; he wrote my mother a very nice note, in his large, clerkly hand, and said he was content to wait for his answer.</p>

<p>‘What would your father have said to it?’ was continually on my poor mother’s lips. ‘ What would his answer have been ?’</p>

<p>Alas ! the silence of the grave lay between us and him, to whom my mother had referred every question of her life to this hour. That is to say, she had let everything take a quiet and even course, directed by his hand, and unquestioned. It was pathetic to me to see the easy-going, placid temperament not ruffled, but saddened. The hopelessness of gaining any help in decision in this, as in other matters, made my position the harder.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliffe called every day, but never pressed himself upon us. At last, one morning, about a fortnight after our father’s death, he sent up his card, and in pencil beneath his name was written, ‘ Seeks the favour of an interview.’</p>

<p>I was sitting with my mother, talking over the future, and looking into letters and bills, when Sarah brought the card.</p>

<p>‘ Go and see him, Constantia. He is a good friend to us; your father liked him.’</p>

<p>‘ I will go if you wish it,’ I said ; and indeed I knew I had much to say to Mr. Hinchcliffe ; for I determined to speak of his grandchildren, and let him know what straits they were in.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliffe was standing before the fire in the drawing-room, and advanced to meet me without a word. He did not speak at first, for he could not ; his lips were quivering with emotion. This sudden loss of my father had evidently touched him deeply. Only those who know what it is to see, as we had seen, a busy, active, earnest life stopped in one moment — to feel that but a step lay between the energy and quick movements of our father and the stillness of death ; that thus, without a word or sign, we had lost him — only those who have had the same experience can enter into the deadening influence of the blow.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchcliffe took my hands in both of his, and the silent sympathy expressed by his eyes, now softened with emotion, was soothing ; and for the first time in all those weary days, gentle tears fell from my eyes with a healing influence.</p>

<p>‘ I came to ask what I can do for you,’ Mr. Hinchcliffe said. ‘ Command me in any way. As I have told you, and your good father and mother, all that I have is <i>yours.</i> Take it now, if it will help you.’</p>

<p>‘ I cannot take it now or in the future,’ I said. ‘There is a barrier between us and the acceptance of this favour at your hands.’</p>

<p>‘ I deny it,’ was the answer ; ‘ there shall be no barrier.’</p>

<p>The softness was gone from that fine face ; the mouth settled into its accustomed hard, cynical lines as he repeated the words :</p>

<p>‘ There shall be no barrier.’</p>

<p>‘ Please,’ I pleaded, ‘ do not resent what I am going to say. I cannot take what is not mine, by all the laws of honour and by all the claims of kindred. I have seen your daughter-in-law.’</p>

<p>‘ Stop ! I acknowledge no such person.’</p>

<p>‘ You would acknowledge her if you saw her,’ I said. ‘ She is the very concentration of all that is lovable in a woman ; fair, and even beautiful she must once have been ; but hard work to prevent her children from starving, and to maintain and keep them in the position of life in which they have been born, has worn her out. Her father, the organist of one of our Cathedral cities, assists her with a small yearly allowance, but —’</p>

<p>‘ Do not say more,’ Mr. Hinchcliffe exclaimed. ‘ I repeat, nothing concerning the person you speak of <i>can</i> interest me. It pains me that you should thus tax my patience.’</p>

<p>‘ I cannot help it,’ I said ; ‘ I <i>must</i> speak out. Your exceeding kindness to me, and your friendship for my father make it hard to speak as I must speak. The great reality of death, which has so unexpectedly made this home desolate, and sent us all out into the world — my mother, my sisters, and myself — seems to bring the necessity of preparation for another life very near. We all stand on its threshold ; we all need forgiveness ; we all feel that we do need it. My father’s last words,’ I said, ‘ speak as a voice from that other world. ” Life without Christ is impossible, for He <i>is</i> our life — <i>the</i> life.” And how can we live in Him with unforgiveness lying deep in our hearts. Indeed, indeed it is death — not life. You <i>must</i> forgive your son !’</p>

<p>Not a sign of relenting passed over that stern face, I was crying now so bitterly that I could not say any more. Mr. Hinchcliffe waited for a few minutes, and then he said :</p>

<p>‘ I would comfort you if I could. I would do everything for you, and you repel me. There is in my heart nothing but love for you, but you cast my affection from you. Well, let it be so ; you must take the consequences, and abide by them. But know ‘ — this was said very solemnly — ‘ <i>know</i> that no tittle of my fortune shall ever be bestowed on my rebellious son or his children. He has chosen his path ; let him tread it to the end — the bitter end. I loved him once, but rejected affection can change to hatred, to contempt, to indifference. Remember these words of mine in days to come, and now, Constantia, I say adieu.’</p>

<p>‘ Stop one moment !’ I exclaimed, ‘ one moment. I am grateful to you ; I do <i>not</i> reject your affection ; you have done so much for me ; but I will not, because I dare not, stand between your son and his rights.’</p>

<p>‘ Say no more ; it is enough ! my fate has pursued me to the utmost limit of my stormy life. Adieu.’</p>

<p>I shall pray for you continually,’ I said, ‘ so will my poor mother. Do not leave me in anger.’</p>

<p>‘ In anger ! Nay, my child ; it is not anger. I doubt not you think my heart is of stone, and do not guess what lies hidden there. Fires of love, which no cold and icy words can freeze nor waters of opposition in a full current quench. Adieu once more !’</p>

<p>And so he left me. Was he, indeed, as his son had said, mad, or was it only the undisciplined, stormy nature which would not submit to the only Hand which could tame it and subdue it ? Was it the strong and defiant will, which owned no allegiance to any higher and greater than itself?</p>

<p>I could not answer those questions then ; I cannot answer them now; but as I heard the sound of Mr. Hinchcliffe’s footsteps growing fainter and fainter as he went down the drive I wept long and bitterly. So much that he <i>might</i> have been, so much that he might have done, unusual powers of mind, grace of manner and culture, widespread knowledge of the world ; riches, rank, and that subtle, and indefinable gift we call ‘ charm ‘ or fascination ; and yet a dark shadow over all— the shadow of separation from God.</p>

<p>Why had I been suffered to cross his path ? why had I been chosen to receive that which resentment against his son had taken from him ? It was like many of life’s lessons, a mystery, and yet through the darkness there gleamed a light. I could bestow on the rightful heirs what ‘ was their due ; I could <i>give</i> what they could not claim legally from me, and I could make restitution. Cuthbert would help me to do so, and I must rest on this.</p>

<p>Nothing more could be done now, and the manifold changes and chances of this mortal life made all contingencies possible. I might not survive Mr. Hinchcliffe, for difference of age is no security ; the uncertainty of our lives, the slender thread by which we hold things temporal, had been brought home to us in a way not easily forgotten ; and ‘ if I live ‘ seemed a less shadowy <i>‘ if’</i> than it often is to us when we use the words.</p>

<p>The three months, at the expiration of which we had to leave our home, were soon over. The days were all filled with the cares and perplexties which such a breaking-up always implies. Friends and neighbours were kind and helpful, but we missed our father at every turn. Some men are cyphers in all domestic and practical matters ; if they get their meals undisturbed and their study or office uninvaded they are contented. They know nothing about the machinery of the household, grumble a little if there is a hitch, but trust implicitly to their wives or daughters to set it going and keep it going.</p>

<p>Precisely the reverse was our case ; from the due distribution of the apples in the orchard to the wine which was ordered from Exeter, my dear father had ruled every detail.</p>

<p>‘ His reverence,’ as our homely, old-fashioned clerk Woollacott called him — ‘ his reverence let nothing <i>go by.</i> Says he many a time to me : ” It is a trouble to keep things straight, but then there’s never no back reckonings ;” but there, Miss Carew, fifty times have I said to my old woman, ” His reverence ought never to go on driving that mare. She’s a vixen, and no mistake !” But his reverence wouldn’t listen, worse luck!’</p>

<p>There were no ‘ back reckonings,’ and all the affairs of the parish and household were found in excellent order.</p>

<p>I was by common consent put by the family into my father’s place ; everything was referred to me, and the girls, as well as my mother, left decision to me. I was not in the least of a practical turn of mind ; figures in an account-book were a penance, questions about a variety of household matters a perpetual irritation. I told all this to my distant friend, who wrote to me regularly, and gave, to my great joy, better accounts of his health.</p>

<p>I had an answer to one of my complaining letters during the last week of my Cranworth life. Cuthbert always said the right thing in the right way.</p>

<p>‘ Take all the worries, all your tangle of arrangements, all the discussions which come therefrom as God’s will for you. Settle it, it is His will, then meet it bravely, with your face well set to the enemy. Don’t let there be any side-issues — no turning your back to a single duty. If you are hard hit, never let it be in the back ; take all the wounds in front, as a good soldier should.’</p>

<p>Then followed words which sweetened the whole.</p>

<p>‘ I wish I could be your adjutant, and fight side by side with you. Poor little Constantia ! I know how much better you like to curl yourself up with a book, or sit and turn into English some of your favourite German poems, or follow old Danté from depth to height, through tortures to bliss. Never mind, this is your way ; and you can mount by worries and trials of patience, just as well as by great sacrifices and less (as you think) ignoble means.’</p>

<p>At last our plans took shape, and it was a relief to have them settled. Marmaduke Headlam had come to Cranworth, and Bridget and he were engaged. True love always raises those who feel it, and Marmaduke decidedly appeared to greater advantage than I could have believed possible.</p>

<p>We were to take a small furnished house at Crofton for a year, and the greater part of our furniture was put into a dry room at Tessington, over the large general shop, till it was wanted. We sold some things to the new-comers, and they decidedly drove a hard bargain with us. ‘</p>

<p>You have given away the things, Miss Carew,’ Susan, our old servant, said ; ‘ it’s a shame, I call it!’</p>

<p>I never could save money by beating down ! In this I was very much like my mother ; and, indeed, as I have said before, we were none of us ‘ addicted to look on both sides of our shillings.’ I Bridget and Rose were invited to stay at The Beeches ; and Mrs. Ball-Baker promised to help them in their search for a house.</p>

<p>‘ It would never do,’ she wrote, ‘ to trust to Awdry or Duke ; they have no notion of what people in straitened circumstances require. You must not look to the fashionable part of Crofton : there’s a new cheap part, where very respectable people live, and I’ll drive the girls over there, and Julia will help them to decide.’</p>

<p>‘ Don’t let us go to Crofton at all !’ Rose exclaimed. ‘I know I shall dislike those rich people. It is different for Bridget, who is going to marry one of them ; but I shall never like the Carringtons, or even the Wilsons, to know, how they speak to us.’</p>

<p>‘ You’ll get over all that,’ Bridget said calmly. ‘ I felt like it when I went to Crofton ; but the Ball-Bakers’ kindness and good nature atone for everything.’</p>

<p>‘ Of course <i>you</i> say so now !’ poor Rose exclaimed ; ‘ I don’t intend to be patronized, or taken up, or pitied for being in straitened circumstances !’</p>

<p>‘ We must try to make the best of everything,’ I said ; ‘ after all we may be thankful we have something to live upon, and are not like some clergyman’s families, positively thrown on the world : we have enough, and shall not starve.’</p>

<p>‘ One day <i>you</i> will have a great deal,’ Rose said ; ‘ so it will not matter to you, Constantia.’</p>

<p>‘ What do you mean, Rose ?’ I asked angrily.</p>

<p>‘ Only that Awdry told me that Mr. Hinchcliffe had made you his heir.’</p>

<p>‘ Who can have told Awdry that?’ I exclaimed. And I heard my mother, who had been in the room during this conversation, say :</p>

<p> <i>‘I</i> told him, Constantia, that it <i>might</i> be. I thought — I thought —’</p>

<p>‘ To tell Awdry is like paying the crier to go round Tessington with the news !’ I said sharply ; and then I repented myself for speaking thus to my poor mother. I heard a suppressed sob, and looking round, I saw the quiet tears coursing each other down her cheeks. I went up to her directly. ‘ I am so sorry I spoke so crossly, mother ; but our father always wished Awdry especially <i>not</i> to know, he thought it would have a bad effect on him.’</p>

<p>‘ Poor boy !’ my mother sighed. ‘ No one could have shown more feeling than he has done lately ; and —’ again tears choked my mother’s utterance.</p>

<p>It was quite true that Awdry had been over whelmed with sorrow at the time of our father’s death. I may say he was helpless with remorseful grief, and I pitied him from my heart. But the tumultuous grief is always the soonest over ; and long before he went back to Crofton he begun to reassert himself. He grew handsomer as he grew older ; and I heard Mr. Hinchcliffe more than once remark on Awdry’s appearance to my mother. For up to the time of our leaving the Rectory Mr. Hinchcliffe kept up his frequent visits; and the first meeting with my mother over, she seemed to look forward to seeing Mr. Hinchcliffe, and by degrees spoke freely to him, as to us, her children, of our father.</p>

<p>The last month of the year was the last month of our Cranworth life. The Passmores were to take possession on the first of January. The duty had been taken temporarily by the curates and rectors of neighbouring parishes on the occasions when Mr. Passmore could not officiate himself.</p>

<p>I was left with my mother to make the final preparations. The two girls were at The Beeches, and had, under Mrs. Ball- Baker’s advice, taken our future home for us, I, Fairview Villas, Chesham Road. Our Christmas was to be spent there. We were all glad not to face that season in the old home, from which the very essence and spirit of home had fled.</p>

<p>I went about in various directions to say goodbye ; and one very brilliant December morning I set out for the Turners’ Farm. During all these sad weeks my visit to Grace had been my chief solace. The beautiful patience of her life acted as an antidote to what was, however much I might conceal it, the restless impatience of my own. At this time I was in one of those moods or phases when all things seem a bewildering maze of mistakes, and to get out of the labyrinth is impossible. <i>If</i> this had been — <i>if</i> this had <i>not</i> been — <i>ifs</i> beset us on every side, and we hang upon them all possible and impossible contingencies, which would have changed the whole aspect of our lives. But how ? for the better or for the worse we know not ; only we restlessly prefer our own conception of what is good for us to God’s. The meaning of all this is, that our wills rebel, and that they are not subservient to His Will.</p>

<p>As I went over the moors this morning, probably for the last time, the clear shining of everything around me seemed to assert the love and wisdom of God. It was winter only in name : the silence of the birds alone told me on this wide expanse of moorland that it was December. If a breath of frost had been in the air the night before the sun had long since dispelled it. The lovely bronze of the old bracken glowed in the warm level rays. Here and there the gorse-bushes sent out a folded bud of gold from the dark-blue green of their prickly maze ; here and there a few little daisies opened their yellow eyes, as if to ask if this were spring ; and some solemn rooks, wheeling round, alighted not many feet before me, their glossy backs shining like polished jet, as with their sharp beaks they sealed the fate of some unwary worm. There was no haze over the landscape as in summer and spring days. The fir trees rose sharply defined against the azure of the cloudless sky, and the line of sea westward reflected the arch above in calm serenity. Winter reigned, and Christmas was near ; but with no leafless trees around me to tell the tale it was hard to realize it.</p>

<p>Grace Turner had improved very much in health. Her mind had regained its tone ; and although the cough and other signs of mischief in her lungs were still present she had so far recovered that she was generally to be found in the little parlour of the farm sheltered from draughts by a folding screen, and able to employ herself in many ways.</p>

<p>She thought, poor child, she owed this to me ; and would often tell me how she had, after the first shock of Awdry’s desertion, felt as if she had no wish to live. ‘ Then came Mrs. Fleming with her message from God ; and then <i>you</i> came to warn me from being selfish, and giving mother so much trouble, and to employ myself in work and other things instead of lying in bed and expecting her to wait on me.’</p>

<p>The entire surrender of her will to One higher and wiser than herself, was striking enough ; and with it all Grace was not in the least self-conscious, or inclined to look down on others from superior vantage ground. As in temporal, so in spiritual things. Those who are really far above their neighbours never force it on the notice of others.</p>

<p>We parted, Grace and I, on this fair winter’s day. I promised to write, as Mrs. Fleming had written, fully and often ; and in that lonely farm house on the moor I knew I left one of my most faithful friends. The time might yet come when I should know Grace had rewarded Roger Parson’s unchanging love, but it would not be yet.</p>

<p>‘ I could not burden him, or anyone, with a sickly wife,’ Grace said ; ‘ and I can never love anybody well enough to marry him : it is better as it is.’</p>

<hr/> <!--Extra space in between paragraphs.-->

<p>The partings were all over : and my mother and I, with Sarah, drove off from the Rectory in the gloom and shadows of a real winter’s morning, through which the sun had not yet pierced. With a thoughtful consideration, which bound me always with a debt of gratitude to the Carringtons, they offered to send their carriage to drive my mother and me, to meet the train at the Junction ; thus we were both spared passing the spot where the blow had fallen, which had made us desolate.</p>

<p>How often I had judged the Carringtons with hard judgment, and scarcely allowed myself to recognise in them anything beyond their pride of place, or rank, or fashion, and complete satisfaction with themselves.</p>

<p>And now this little act of considerate kindness came like ‘an angel’s healing’ to sore hearts.</p>

<p>Such little acts lie within the power of many to perform, and are ‘ twice blessed.’ How is it that so many miss that double benediction, and turn from the often repeated chance of claiming it as their own ?</p>
