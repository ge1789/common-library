<title>Chapter 3 of The Haunted Man and the Ghost’s Bargain by Charles Dickens</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!—CHAPTER III—The Gift Reversed—>
<p>Night was still heavy in the sky. On open plains, from
hill-tops, and from the decks of solitary ships at sea, a distant
low-lying line, that promised by-and-by to change to light, was
visible in the dim horizon; but its promise was remote and
doubtful, and the moon was striving with the night-clouds
busily.</p>
<p>The shadows upon Redlaw’s mind succeeded thick and fast
to one another, and obscured its light as the night-clouds
hovered between the moon and earth, and kept the latter veiled in
darkness. Fitful and uncertain as the shadows which the
night-clouds cast, were their concealments from him, and
imperfect revelations to him; and, like the night-clouds still,
if the clear light broke forth for a moment, it was only that
they might sweep over it, and make the darkness deeper than
before.</p>
<p>Without, there was a profound and solemn hush upon the ancient
pile of building, and its buttresses and angles made dark shapes
of mystery upon the ground, which now seemed to retire into the
smooth white snow and now seemed to come out of it, as the
moon’s path was more or less beset. Within, the
Chemist’s room was indistinct and murky, by the light of
the expiring lamp; a ghostly silence had succeeded to the
knocking and the voice outside; nothing was audible but, now and
then, a low sound among the whitened ashes of the fire, as of its
yielding up its last breath. Before it on the ground the
boy lay fast asleep. In his chair, the Chemist sat, as he
had sat there since the calling at his door had ceased—like
a man turned to stone.</p>
<p>At such a time, the Christmas music he had heard before, began
to play. He listened to it at first, as he had listened in
the church-yard; but presently—it playing still, and being
borne towards him on the night air, in a low, sweet, melancholy
strain—he rose, and stood stretching his hands about him,
as if there were some friend approaching within his reach, on
whom his desolate touch might rest, yet do no harm. As he
did this, his face became less fixed and wondering; a gentle
trembling came upon him; and at last his eyes filled with tears,
and he put his hands before them, and bowed down his head.</p>
<p>His memory of sorrow, wrong, and trouble, had not come back to
him; he knew that it was not restored; he had no passing belief
or hope that it was. But some dumb stir within him made him
capable, again, of being moved by what was hidden, afar off, in
the music. If it were only that it told him sorrowfully the
value of what he had lost, he thanked Heaven for it with a
fervent gratitude.</p>
<p>As the last chord died upon his ear, he raised his head to
listen to its lingering vibration. Beyond the boy, so that
his sleeping figure lay at its feet, the Phantom stood, immovable
and silent, with its eyes upon him.</p>
<p>Ghastly it was, as it had ever been, but not so cruel and
relentless in its aspect—or he thought or hoped so, as he
looked upon it trembling. It was not alone, but in its
shadowy hand it held another hand.</p>
<p>And whose was that? Was the form that stood beside it
indeed Milly’s, or but her shade and picture? The
quiet head was bent a little, as her manner was, and her eyes
were looking down, as if in pity, on the sleeping child. A
radiant light fell on her face, but did not touch the Phantom;
for, though close beside her, it was dark and colourless as
ever.</p>
<p>“Spectre!” said the Chemist, newly troubled as he
looked, “I have not been stubborn or presumptuous in
respect of her. Oh, do not bring her here. Spare me
that!”</p>
<p>“This is but a shadow,” said the Phantom;
“when the morning shines seek out the reality whose image I
present before you.”</p>
<p>“Is it my inexorable doom to do so?” cried the
Chemist.</p>
<p>“It is,” replied the Phantom.</p>
<p>“To destroy her peace, her goodness; to make her what I
am myself, and what I have made of others!”</p>
<p>“I have said seek her out,” returned the
Phantom. “I have said no more.”</p>
<p>“Oh, tell me,” exclaimed Redlaw, catching at the
hope which he fancied might lie hidden in the words.
“Can I undo what I have done?”</p>
<p>“No,” returned the Phantom.</p>
<p>“I do not ask for restoration to myself,” said
Redlaw. “What I abandoned, I abandoned of my own free
will, and have justly lost. But for those to whom I have
transferred the fatal gift; who never sought it; who unknowingly
received a curse of which they had no warning, and which they had
no power to shun; can I do nothing?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said the Phantom.</p>
<p>“If I cannot, can any one?”</p>
<p>The Phantom, standing like a statue, kept its gaze upon him
for a while; then turned its head suddenly, and looked upon the
shadow at its side.</p>
<p>“Ah! Can she?” cried Redlaw, still looking
upon the shade.</p>
<p>The Phantom released the hand it had retained till now, and
softly raised its own with a gesture of dismissal. Upon
that, her shadow, still preserving the same attitude, began to
move or melt away.</p>
<p>“Stay,” cried Redlaw with an earnestness to which
he could not give enough expression. “For a
moment! As an act of mercy! I know that some change
fell upon me, when those sounds were in the air just now.
Tell me, have I lost the power of harming her? May I go
near her without dread? Oh, let her give me any sign of
hope!”</p>
<p>The Phantom looked upon the shade as he did—not at
him—and gave no answer.</p>
<p>“At least, say this—has she, henceforth, the
consciousness of any power to set right what I have
done?”</p>
<p>“She has not,” the Phantom answered.</p>
<p>“Has she the power bestowed on her without the
consciousness?”</p>
<p>The phantom answered: “Seek her out.”</p>
<p>And her shadow slowly vanished.</p>
<p>They were face to face again, and looking on each other, as
intently and awfully as at the time of the bestowal of the gift,
across the boy who still lay on the ground between them, at the
Phantom’s feet.</p>
<p>“Terrible instructor,” said the Chemist, sinking
on his knee before it, in an attitude of supplication, “by
whom I was renounced, but by whom I am revisited (in which, and
in whose milder aspect, I would fain believe I have a gleam of
hope), I will obey without inquiry, praying that the cry I have
sent up in the anguish of my soul has been, or will be, heard, in
behalf of those whom I have injured beyond human
reparation. But there is one thing—”</p>
<p>“You speak to me of what is lying here,” the
phantom interposed, and pointed with its finger to the boy.</p>
<p>“I do,” returned the Chemist. “You
know what I would ask. Why has this child alone been proof
against my influence, and why, why, have I detected in its
thoughts a terrible companionship with mine?”</p>
<p>“This,” said the Phantom, pointing to the boy,
“is the last, completest illustration of a human creature,
utterly bereft of such remembrances as you have yielded up.
No softening memory of sorrow, wrong, or trouble enters here,
because this wretched mortal from his birth has been abandoned to
a worse condition than the beasts, and has, within his knowledge,
no one contrast, no humanising touch, to make a grain of such a
memory spring up in his hardened breast. All within this
desolate creature is barren wilderness. All within the man
bereft of what you have resigned, is the same barren
wilderness. Woe to such a man! Woe, tenfold, to the
nation that shall count its monsters such as this, lying here, by
hundreds and by thousands!”</p>
<p>Redlaw shrank, appalled, from what he heard.</p>
<p>“There is not,” said the Phantom, “one of
these—not one—but sows a harvest that mankind must reap. From every seed of evil
in this boy, a field of ruin is grown that shall be gathered in,
and garnered up, and sown again in many places in the world,
until regions are overspread with wickedness enough to raise the
waters of another Deluge. Open and unpunished murder in a
city’s streets would be less guilty in its daily
toleration, than one such spectacle as this.”</p>
<p>It seemed to look down upon the boy in his sleep.
Redlaw, too, looked down upon him with a new emotion.</p>
<p>“There is not a father,” said the Phantom,
“by whose side in his daily or his nightly walk, these
creatures pass; there is not a mother among all the ranks of
loving mothers in this land; there is no one risen from the state
of childhood, but shall be responsible in his or her degree for
this enormity. There is not a country throughout the earth
on which it would not bring a curse. There is no religion
upon earth that it would not deny; there is no people upon earth
it would not put to shame.”</p>
<p>The Chemist clasped his hands, and looked, with trembling fear
and pity, from the sleeping boy to the Phantom, standing above
him with his finger pointing down.</p>
<p>“Behold, I say,” pursued the Spectre, “the
perfect type of what it was your choice to be. Your
influence is powerless here, because from this child’s
bosom you can banish nothing. His thoughts have been in
‘terrible companionship’ with yours, because you have
gone down to his unnatural level. He is the growth of
man’s indifference; you are the growth of man’s
presumption. The beneficent design of Heaven is, in each
case, overthrown, and from the two poles of the immaterial world
you come together.”</p>
<p>The Chemist stooped upon the ground beside the boy, and, with
the same kind of compassion for him that he now felt for himself,
covered him as he slept, and no longer shrank from him with
abhorrence or indifference.</p>
<p>Soon, now, the distant line on the horizon brightened, the
darkness faded, the sun rose red and glorious, and the chimney
stacks and gables of the ancient building gleamed in the clear
air, which turned the smoke and vapour of the city into a cloud
of gold. The very sun-dial in his shady corner, where the
wind was used to spin with such unwindy constancy, shook off the
finer particles of snow that had accumulated on his dull old face
in the night, and looked out at the little white wreaths eddying
round and round him. Doubtless some blind groping of the
morning made its way down into the forgotten crypt so cold and
earthy, where the Norman arches were half buried in the ground,
and stirred the dull sap in the lazy vegetation hanging to the
walls, and quickened the slow principle of life within the little
world of wonderful and delicate creation which existed there,
with some faint knowledge that the sun was up.</p>
<p>The Tetterbys were up, and doing. Mr. Tetterby took down
the shutters of the shop, and, strip by strip, revealed the
treasures of the window to the eyes, so proof against their
seductions, of Jerusalem Buildings. Adolphus had been out
so long already, that he was halfway on to “Morning
Pepper.” Five small Tetterbys, whose ten round eyes
were much inflamed by soap and friction, were in the tortures of
a cool wash in the back kitchen; Mrs. Tetterby presiding.
Johnny, who was pushed and hustled through his toilet with great
rapidity when Moloch chanced to be in an exacting frame of mind
(which was always the case), staggered up and down with his
charge before the shop door, under greater difficulties than
usual; the weight of Moloch being much increased by a
complication of defences against the cold, composed of knitted
worsted-work, and forming a complete suit of chain-armour, with a
head-piece and blue gaiters.</p>
<p>It was a peculiarity of this baby to be always cutting
teeth. Whether they never came, or whether they came and
went away again, is not in evidence; but it had certainly cut
enough, on the showing of Mrs. Tetterby, to make a handsome
dental provision for the sign of the Bull and Mouth. All
sorts of objects were impressed for the rubbing of its gums,
notwithstanding that it always carried, dangling at its waist
(which was immediately under its chin), a bone ring, large enough
to have represented the rosary of a young nun.
Knife-handles, umbrella-tops, the heads of walking-sticks
selected from the stock, the fingers of the family in general,
but especially of Johnny, nutmeg-graters, crusts, the handles of
doors, and the cool knobs on the tops of pokers, were among the
commonest instruments indiscriminately applied for this
baby’s relief. The amount of electricity that must
have been rubbed out of it in a week, is not to be
calculated. Still Mrs. Tetterby always said “it was
coming through, and then the child would be herself;” and
still it never did come through, and the child continued to be
somebody else.</p>
<p>The tempers of the little Tetterbys had sadly changed with a
few hours. Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby themselves were not more
altered than their offspring. Usually they were an
unselfish, good-natured, yielding little race, sharing short
commons when it happened (which was pretty often) contentedly and
even generously, and taking a great deal of enjoyment out of a
very little meat. But they were fighting now, not only for
the soap and water, but even for the breakfast which was yet in
perspective. The hand of every little Tetterby was against
the other little Tetterbys; and even Johnny’s
hand—the patient, much-enduring, and devoted
Johnny—rose against the baby! Yes, Mrs. Tetterby,
going to the door by mere accident, saw him viciously pick out a
weak place in the suit of armour where a slap would tell, and
slap that blessed child.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tetterby had him into the parlour by the collar, in that
same flash of time, and repaid him the assault with usury
thereto.</p>
<p>“You brute, you murdering little boy,” said Mrs.
Tetterby. “Had you the heart to do it?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t her teeth come through, then,”
retorted Johnny, in a loud rebellious voice, “instead of
bothering me? How would you like it yourself?”</p>
<p>“Like it, sir!” said Mrs. Tetterby, relieving him
of his dishonoured load.</p>
<p>“Yes, like it,” said Johnny. “How
would you? Not at all. If you was me, you’d go
for a soldier. I will, too. There an’t no
babies in the Army.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tetterby, who had arrived upon the scene of action, rubbed
his chin thoughtfully, instead of correcting the rebel, and
seemed rather struck by this view of a military life.</p>
<p>“I wish I was in the Army myself, if the child’s
in the right,” said Mrs. Tetterby, looking at her husband,
“for I have no peace of my life here. I’m a
slave—a Virginia slave:” some indistinct association
with their weak descent on the tobacco trade perhaps suggested
this aggravated expression to Mrs. Tetterby. “I never
have a holiday, or any pleasure at all, from year’s end to
year’s end! Why, Lord bless and save the
child,” said Mrs. Tetterby, shaking the baby with an
irritability hardly suited to so pious an aspiration,
“what’s the matter with her now?”</p>
<p>Not being able to discover, and not rendering the subject much
clearer by shaking it, Mrs. Tetterby put the baby away in a
cradle, and, folding her arms, sat rocking it angrily with her
foot.</p>
<p>“How you stand there, ‘Dolphus,” said Mrs.
Tetterby to her husband. “Why don’t you do
something?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t care about doing anything,”
Mr. Tetterby replied.</p>
<p>“I am sure <i>I</i> don’t,” said Mrs.
Tetterby.</p>
<p>“I’ll take my oath <i>I</i> don’t,”
said Mr. Tetterby.</p>
<p>A diversion arose here among Johnny and his five younger
brothers, who, in preparing the family breakfast table, had
fallen to skirmishing for the temporary possession of the loaf,
and were buffeting one another with great heartiness; the
smallest boy of all, with precocious discretion, hovering outside
the knot of combatants, and harassing their legs. Into the
midst of this fray, Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby both precipitated
themselves with great ardour, as if such ground were the only
ground on which they could now agree; and having, with no visible
remains of their late soft-heartedness, laid about them without
any lenity, and done much execution, resumed their former
relative positions.</p>
<p>“You had better read your paper than do nothing at
all,” said Mrs. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“What’s there to read in a paper?” returned
Mr. Tetterby, with excessive discontent.</p>
<p>“What?” said Mrs. Tetterby.
“Police.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing to me,” said Tetterby.
“What do I care what people do, or are done to?”</p>
<p>“Suicides,” suggested Mrs. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“No business of mine,” replied her husband.</p>
<p>“Births, deaths, and marriages, are those nothing to
you?” said Mrs. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“If the births were all over for good, and all to-day;
and the deaths were all to begin to come off to-morrow; I
don’t see why it should interest me, till I thought it was
a coming to my turn,” grumbled Tetterby. “As to
marriages, I’ve done it myself. I know quite enough
about <i>them</i>.”</p>
<p>To judge from the dissatisfied expression of her face and
manner, Mrs. Tetterby appeared to entertain the same opinions as
her husband; but she opposed him, nevertheless, for the
gratification of quarrelling with him.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re a consistent man,” said Mrs.
Tetterby, “an’t you? You, with the screen of
your own making there, made of nothing else but bits of
newspapers, which you sit and read to the children by the
half-hour together!”</p>
<p>“Say used to, if you please,” returned her
husband. “You won’t find me doing so any
more. I’m wiser now.”</p>
<p>“Bah! wiser, indeed!” said Mrs. Tetterby.
“Are you better?”</p>
<p>The question sounded some discordant note in Mr.
Tetterby’s breast. He ruminated dejectedly, and
passed his hand across and across his forehead.</p>
<p>“Better!” murmured Mr. Tetterby. “I
don’t know as any of us are better, or happier
either. Better, is it?”</p>
<p>He turned to the screen, and traced about it with his finger,
until he found a certain paragraph of which he was in quest.</p>
<p>“This used to be one of the family favourites, I
recollect,” said Tetterby, in a forlorn and stupid way,
“and used to draw tears from the children, and make
‘em good, if there was any little bickering or discontent
among ‘em, next to the story of the robin redbreasts in the
wood. ‘Melancholy case of destitution.
Yesterday a small man, with a baby in his arms, and surrounded by
half-a-dozen ragged little ones, of various ages between ten and
two, the whole of whom were evidently in a famishing condition,
appeared before the worthy magistrate, and made the following
recital:’—Ha! I don’t understand it,
I’m sure,” said Tetterby; “I don’t see
what it has got to do with us.”</p>
<p>“How old and shabby he looks,” said Mrs. Tetterby,
watching him. “I never saw such a change in a
man. Ah! dear me, dear me, dear me, it was a
sacrifice!”</p>
<p>“What was a sacrifice?” her husband sourly
inquired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tetterby shook her head; and without replying in words,
raised a complete sea-storm about the baby, by her violent
agitation of the cradle.</p>
<p>“If you mean your marriage was a sacrifice, my good
woman—” said her husband.</p>
<p>“I <i>do</i> mean it,” said his wife.</p>
<p>“Why, then I mean to say,” pursued Mr. Tetterby,
as sulkily and surlily as she, “that there are two sides to
that affair; and that I was the sacrifice; and that I wish the
sacrifice hadn’t been accepted.”</p>
<p>“I wish it hadn’t, Tetterby, with all my heart and
soul I do assure you,” said his wife. “You
can’t wish it more than I do, Tetterby.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what I saw in her,” muttered
the newsman, “I’m sure;—certainly, if I saw
anything, it’s not there now. I was thinking so, last
night, after supper, by the fire. She’s fat,
she’s ageing, she won’t bear comparison with most
other women.”</p>
<p>“He’s common-looking, he has no air with him,
he’s small, he’s beginning to stoop and he’s
getting bald,” muttered Mrs. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“I must have been half out of my mind when I did
it,” muttered Mr. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“My senses must have forsook me. That’s the
only way in which I can explain it to myself,” said Mrs.
Tetterby with elaboration.</p>
<p>In this mood they sat down to breakfast. The little
Tetterbys were not habituated to regard that meal in the light of
a sedentary occupation, but discussed it as a dance or trot;
rather resembling a savage ceremony, in the occasionally shrill
whoops, and brandishings of bread and butter, with which it was
accompanied, as well as in the intricate filings off into the
street and back again, and the hoppings up and down the
door-steps, which were incidental to the performance. In
the present instance, the contentions between these Tetterby
children for the milk-and-water jug, common to all, which stood
upon the table, presented so lamentable an instance of angry
passions risen very high indeed, that it was an outrage on the
memory of Dr. Watts. It was not until Mr. Tetterby had
driven the whole herd out at the front door, that a
moment’s peace was secured; and even that was broken by the
discovery that Johnny had surreptitiously come back, and was at
that instant choking in the jug like a ventriloquist, in his
indecent and rapacious haste.</p>
<p>“These children will be the death of me at last!”
said Mrs. Tetterby, after banishing the culprit. “And
the sooner the better, I think.”</p>
<p>“Poor people,” said Mr. Tetterby, “ought not
to have children at all. They give <i>us</i> no
pleasure.”</p>
<p>He was at that moment taking up the cup which Mrs. Tetterby
had rudely pushed towards him, and Mrs. Tetterby was lifting her
own cup to her lips, when they both stopped, as if they were
transfixed.</p>
<p>“Here! Mother! Father!” cried Johnny,
running into the room. “Here’s Mrs. William
coming down the street!”</p>
<p>And if ever, since the world began, a young boy took a baby
from a cradle with the care of an old nurse, and hushed and
soothed it tenderly, and tottered away with it cheerfully, Johnny
was that boy, and Moloch was that baby, as they went out
together!</p>
<p>Mr. Tetterby put down his cup; Mrs. Tetterby put down her
cup. Mr. Tetterby rubbed his forehead; Mrs. Tetterby rubbed
hers. Mr. Tetterby’s face began to smooth and
brighten; Mrs. Tetterby’s began to smooth and brighten.</p>
<p>“Why, Lord forgive me,” said Mr. Tetterby to
himself, “what evil tempers have I been giving way
to? What has been the matter here!”</p>
<p>“How could I ever treat him ill again, after all I said
and felt last night!” sobbed Mrs. Tetterby, with her apron
to her eyes.</p>
<p>“Am I a brute,” said Mr. Tetterby, “or is
there any good in me at all? Sophia! My little
woman!”</p>
<p>“‘Dolphus dear,” returned his wife.</p>
<p>“I—I’ve been in a state of mind,” said
Mr. Tetterby, “that I can’t abear to think of,
Sophy.”</p>
<p>“Oh! It’s nothing to what I’ve been
in, Dolf,” cried his wife in a great burst of grief.</p>
<p>“My Sophia,” said Mr. Tetterby, “don’t
take on. I never shall forgive myself. I must have
nearly broke your heart, I know.”</p>
<p>“No, Dolf, no. It was me! Me!” cried
Mrs. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“My little woman,” said her husband,
“don’t. You make me reproach myself dreadful,
when you show such a noble spirit. Sophia, my dear, you
don’t know what I thought. I showed it bad enough, no
doubt; but what I thought, my little woman!—”</p>
<p>“Oh, dear Dolf, don’t! Don’t!”
cried his wife.</p>
<p>“Sophia,” said Mr. Tetterby, “I must reveal
it. I couldn’t rest in my conscience unless I
mentioned it. My little woman—”</p>
<p>“Mrs. William’s very nearly here!” screamed
Johnny at the door.</p>
<p>“My little woman, I wondered how,” gasped Mr.
Tetterby, supporting himself by his chair, “I wondered how
I had ever admired you—I forgot the precious children you
have brought about me, and thought you didn’t look as slim
as I could wish. I—I never gave a
recollection,” said Mr. Tetterby, with severe
self-accusation, “to the cares you’ve had as my wife,
and along of me and mine, when you might have had hardly any with
another man, who got on better and was luckier than me (anybody
might have found such a man easily I am sure); and I quarrelled
with you for having aged a little in the rough years you have
lightened for me. Can you believe it, my little
woman? I hardly can myself.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Tetterby, in a whirlwind of laughing and crying, caught
his face within her hands, and held it there.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dolf!” she cried. “I am so happy
that you thought so; I am so grateful that you thought so!
For I thought that you were common-looking, Dolf; and so you are,
my dear, and may you be the commonest of all sights in my eyes,
till you close them with your own good hands. I thought
that you were small; and so you are, and I’ll make much of
you because you are, and more of you because I love my
husband. I thought that you began to stoop; and so you do,
and you shall lean on me, and I’ll do all I can to keep you
up. I thought there was no air about you; but there is, and
it’s the air of home, and that’s the purest and the
best there is, and God bless home once more, and all belonging to
it, Dolf!”</p>
<p>“Hurrah! Here’s Mrs. William!” cried
Johnny.</p>
<p>So she was, and all the children with her; and so she came in,
they kissed her, and kissed one another, and kissed the baby, and
kissed their father and mother, and then ran back and flocked and
danced about her, trooping on with her in triumph.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby were not a bit behind-hand in the warmth
of their reception. They were as much attracted to her as
the children were; they ran towards her, kissed her hands,
pressed round her, could not receive her ardently or
enthusiastically enough. She came among them like the
spirit of all goodness, affection, gentle consideration, love,
and domesticity.</p>
<p>“What! are <i>you</i> all so glad to see me, too, this
bright Christmas morning?” said Milly, clapping her hands
in a pleasant wonder. “Oh dear, how delightful this
is!”</p>
<p>More shouting from the children, more kissing, more trooping
round her, more happiness, more love, more joy, more honour, on
all sides, than she could bear.</p>
<p>“Oh dear!” said Milly, “what delicious tears
you make me shed. How can I ever have deserved this!
What have I done to be so loved?”</p>
<p>“Who can help it!” cried Mr. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“Who can help it!” cried Mrs. Tetterby.</p>
<p>“Who can help it!” echoed the children, in a
joyful chorus. And they danced and trooped about her again,
and clung to her, and laid their rosy faces against her dress,
and kissed and fondled it, and could not fondle it, or her,
enough.</p>
<p>“I never was so moved,” said Milly, drying her
eyes, “as I have been this morning. I must tell you,
as soon as I can speak.—Mr. Redlaw came to me at sunrise,
and with a tenderness in his manner, more as if I had been his
darling daughter than myself, implored me to go with him to where
William’s brother George is lying ill. We went
together, and all the way along he was so kind, and so subdued,
and seemed to put such trust and hope in me, that I could not
help crying with pleasure. When we got to the house, we met
a woman at the door (somebody had bruised and hurt her, I am
afraid), who caught me by the hand, and blessed me as I
passed.”</p>
<p>“She was right!” said Mr. Tetterby. Mrs.
Tetterby said she was right. All the children cried out
that she was right.</p>
<p>“Ah, but there’s more than that,” said
Milly. “When we got up stairs, into the room, the
sick man who had lain for hours in a state from which no effort
could rouse him, rose up in his bed, and, bursting into tears,
stretched out his arms to me, and said that he had led a
mis-spent life, but that he was truly repentant now, in his
sorrow for the past, which was all as plain to him as a great
prospect, from which a dense black cloud had cleared away, and
that he entreated me to ask his poor old father for his pardon
and his blessing, and to say a prayer beside his bed. And
when I did so, Mr. Redlaw joined in it so fervently, and then so
thanked and thanked me, and thanked Heaven, that my heart quite
overflowed, and I could have done nothing but sob and cry, if the
sick man had not begged me to sit down by him,—which made
me quiet of course. As I sat there, he held my hand in his
until he sank in a doze; and even then, when I withdrew my hand
to leave him to come here (which Mr. Redlaw was very earnest
indeed in wishing me to do), his hand felt for mine, so that some
one else was obliged to take my place and make believe to give
him my hand back. Oh dear, oh dear,” said Milly,
sobbing. “How thankful and how happy I should feel,
and do feel, for all this!”</p>
<p>While she was speaking, Redlaw had come in, and, after pausing
for a moment to observe the group of which she was the centre,
had silently ascended the stairs. Upon those stairs he now
appeared again; remaining there, while the young student passed
him, and came running down.</p>
<p>“Kind nurse, gentlest, best of creatures,” he
said, falling on his knee to her, and catching at her hand,
“forgive my cruel ingratitude!”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, oh dear!” cried Milly innocently,
“here’s another of them! Oh dear, here’s
somebody else who likes me. What shall I ever
do!”</p>
<p>The guileless, simple way in which she said it, and in which
she put her hands before her eyes and wept for very happiness,
was as touching as it was delightful.</p>
<p>“I was not myself,” he said. “I
don’t know what it was—it was some consequence of my
disorder perhaps—I was mad. But I am so no
longer. Almost as I speak, I am restored. I heard the
children crying out your name, and the shade passed from me at
the very sound of it. Oh, don’t weep! Dear
Milly, if you could read my heart, and only knew with what
affection and what grateful homage it is glowing, you would not
let me see you weep. It is such deep reproach.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Milly, “it’s not
that. It’s not indeed. It’s joy.
It’s wonder that you should think it necessary to ask me to
forgive so little, and yet it’s pleasure that you
do.”</p>
<p>“And will you come again? and will you finish the little
curtain?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Milly, drying her eyes, and shaking her
head. “You won’t care for my needlework
now.”</p>
<p>“Is it forgiving me, to say that?”</p>
<p>She beckoned him aside, and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>“There is news from your home, Mr. Edmund.”</p>
<p>“News? How?”</p>
<p>“Either your not writing when you were very ill, or the
change in your handwriting when you began to be better, created
some suspicion of the truth; however that is—but
you’re sure you’ll not be the worse for any news, if
it’s not bad news?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Then there’s some one come!” said
Milly.</p>
<p>“My mother?” asked the student, glancing round
involuntarily towards Redlaw, who had come down from the
stairs.</p>
<p>“Hush! No,” said Milly.</p>
<p>“It can be no one else.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?” said Milly, “are you
sure?”</p>
<p>“It is not—” Before he could say more,
she put her hand upon his mouth.</p>
<p>“Yes it is!” said Milly. “The young
lady (she is very like the miniature, Mr. Edmund, but she is
prettier) was too unhappy to rest without satisfying her doubts,
and came up, last night, with a little servant-maid. As you
always dated your letters from the college, she came there; and
before I saw Mr. Redlaw this morning, I saw her. <i>She</i>
likes me too!” said Milly. “Oh dear,
that’s another!”</p>
<p>“This morning! Where is she now?”</p>
<p>“Why, she is now,” said Milly, advancing her lips
to his ear, “in my little parlour in the Lodge, and waiting
to see you.”</p>
<p>He pressed her hand, and was darting off, but she detained
him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Redlaw is much altered, and has told me this
morning that his memory is impaired. Be very considerate to
him, Mr. Edmund; he needs that from us all.”</p>
<p>The young man assured her, by a look, that her caution was not
ill-bestowed; and as he passed the Chemist on his way out, bent
respectfully and with an obvious interest before him.</p>
<p>Redlaw returned the salutation courteously and even humbly,
and looked after him as he passed on. He dropped his head
upon his hand too, as trying to reawaken something he had
lost. But it was gone.</p>
<p>The abiding change that had come upon him since the influence
of the music, and the Phantom’s reappearance, was, that now
he truly felt how much he had lost, and could compassionate his
own condition, and contrast it, clearly, with the natural state
of those who were around him. In this, an interest in those
who were around him was revived, and a meek, submissive sense of
his calamity was bred, resembling that which sometimes obtains in
age, when its mental powers are weakened, without insensibility
or sullenness being added to the list of its infirmities.</p>
<p>He was conscious that, as he redeemed, through Milly, more and
more of the evil he had done, and as he was more and more with
her, this change ripened itself within him. Therefore, and
because of the attachment she inspired him with (but without
other hope), he felt that he was quite dependent on her, and that
she was his staff in his affliction.</p>
<p>So, when she asked him whether they should go home now, to
where the old man and her husband were, and he readily replied
“yes”—being anxious in that regard—he put
his arm through hers, and walked beside her; not as if he were
the wise and learned man to whom the wonders of Nature were an
open book, and hers were the uninstructed mind, but as if their
two positions were reversed, and he knew nothing, and she
all.</p>
<p>He saw the children throng about her, and caress her, as he
and she went away together thus, out of the house; he heard the
ringing of their laughter, and their merry voices; he saw their
bright faces, clustering around him like flowers; he witnessed
the renewed contentment and affection of their parents; he
breathed the simple air of their poor home, restored to its
tranquillity; he thought of the unwholesome blight he had shed
upon it, and might, but for her, have been diffusing then; and
perhaps it is no wonder that he walked submissively beside her,
and drew her gentle bosom nearer to his own.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Lodge, the old man was sitting in his
chair in the chimney-corner, with his eyes fixed on the ground,
and his son was leaning against the opposite side of the
fire-place, looking at him. As she came in at the door,
both started, and turned round towards her, and a radiant change
came upon their faces.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, dear, dear, they are all pleased to see me
like the rest!” cried Milly, clapping her hands in an
ecstasy, and stopping short. “Here are two
more!”</p>
<p>Pleased to see her! Pleasure was no word for it.
She ran into her husband’s arms, thrown wide open to
receive her, and he would have been glad to have her there, with
her head lying on his shoulder, through the short winter’s
day. But the old man couldn’t spare her. He had
arms for her too, and he locked her in them.</p>
<p>“Why, where has my quiet Mouse been all this
time?” said the old man. “She has been a long
while away. I find that it’s impossible for me to get
on without Mouse. I—where’s my son
William?—I fancy I have been dreaming, William.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I say myself, father,” returned
his son. “I have been in an ugly sort of dream, I
think.—How are you, father? Are you pretty
well?”</p>
<p>“Strong and brave, my boy,” returned the old
man.</p>
<p>It was quite a sight to see Mr. William shaking hands with his
father, and patting him on the back, and rubbing him gently down
with his hand, as if he could not possibly do enough to show an
interest in him.</p>
<p>“What a wonderful man you are, father!—How are
you, father? Are you really pretty hearty, though?”
said William, shaking hands with him again, and patting him
again, and rubbing him gently down again.</p>
<p>“I never was fresher or stouter in my life, my
boy.”</p>
<p>“What a wonderful man you are, father! But
that’s exactly where it is,” said Mr. William, with
enthusiasm. “When I think of all that my
father’s gone through, and all the chances and changes, and
sorrows and troubles, that have happened to him in the course of
his long life, and under which his head has grown grey, and years
upon years have gathered on it, I feel as if we couldn’t do
enough to honour the old gentleman, and make his old age
easy.—How are you, father? Are you really pretty
well, though?”</p>
<p>Mr. William might never have left off repeating this inquiry,
and shaking hands with him again, and patting him again, and
rubbing him down again, if the old man had not espied the
Chemist, whom until now he had not seen.</p>
<p>“I ask your pardon, Mr. Redlaw,” said Philip,
“but didn’t know you were here, sir, or should have
made less free. It reminds me, Mr. Redlaw, seeing you here
on a Christmas morning, of the time when you was a student
yourself, and worked so hard that you were backwards and forwards
in our Library even at Christmas time. Ha! ha!
I’m old enough to remember that; and I remember it right
well, I do, though I am eighty-seven. It was after you left
here that my poor wife died. You remember my poor wife, Mr.
Redlaw?”</p>
<p>The Chemist answered yes.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the old man. “She was a
dear creetur.—I recollect you come here one Christmas
morning with a young lady—I ask your pardon, Mr. Redlaw,
but I think it was a sister you was very much attached
to?”</p>
<p>The Chemist looked at him, and shook his head. “I
had a sister,” he said vacantly. He knew no more.</p>
<p>“One Christmas morning,” pursued the old man,
“that you come here with her—and it began to snow,
and my wife invited the lady to walk in, and sit by the fire that
is always a burning on Christmas Day in what used to be, before
our ten poor gentlemen commuted, our great Dinner Hall. I
was there; and I recollect, as I was stirring up the blaze for
the young lady to warm her pretty feet by, she read the scroll
out loud, that is underneath that pictur, ‘Lord, keep my
memory green!’ She and my poor wife fell a talking
about it; and it’s a strange thing to think of, now, that
they both said (both being so unlike to die) that it was a good
prayer, and that it was one they would put up very earnestly, if
they were called away young, with reference to those who were
dearest to them. ‘My brother,’ says the young
lady—’My husband,’ says my poor
wife.—’Lord, keep his memory of me, green, and do not
let me be forgotten!’”</p>
<p>Tears more painful, and more bitter than he had ever shed in
all his life, coursed down Redlaw’s face. Philip,
fully occupied in recalling his story, had not observed him until
now, nor Milly’s anxiety that he should not proceed.</p>
<p>“Philip!” said Redlaw, laying his hand upon his
arm, “I am a stricken man, on whom the hand of Providence
has fallen heavily, although deservedly. You speak to me,
my friend, of what I cannot follow; my memory is gone.”</p>
<p>“Merciful power!” cried the old man.</p>
<p>“I have lost my memory of sorrow, wrong, and
trouble,” said the Chemist, “and with that I have
lost all man would remember!”</p>
<p>To see old Philip’s pity for him, to see him wheel his
own great chair for him to rest in, and look down upon him with a
solemn sense of his bereavement, was to know, in some degree, how
precious to old age such recollections are.</p>
<p>The boy came running in, and ran to Milly.</p>
<p>“Here’s the man,” he said, “in the
other room. I don’t want <i>him</i>.”</p>
<p>“What man does he mean?” asked Mr. William.</p>
<p>“Hush!” said Milly.</p>
<p>Obedient to a sign from her, he and his old father softly
withdrew. As they went out, unnoticed, Redlaw beckoned to
the boy to come to him.</p>
<p>“I like the woman best,” he answered, holding to
her skirts.</p>
<p>“You are right,” said Redlaw, with a faint
smile. “But you needn’t fear to come to
me. I am gentler than I was. Of all the world, to
you, poor child!”</p>
<p>The boy still held back at first, but yielding little by
little to her urging, he consented to approach, and even to sit
down at his feet. As Redlaw laid his hand upon the shoulder
of the child, looking on him with compassion and a
fellow-feeling, he put out his other hand to Milly. She
stooped down on that side of him, so that she could look into his
face, and after silence, said:</p>
<p>“Mr. Redlaw, may I speak to you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered, fixing his eyes upon
her. “Your voice and music are the same to
me.”</p>
<p>“May I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“What you will.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember what I said, when I knocked at your
door last night? About one who was your friend once, and
who stood on the verge of destruction?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I remember,” he said, with some
hesitation.</p>
<p>“Do you understand it?”</p>
<p>He smoothed the boy’s hair—looking at her fixedly
the while, and shook his head.</p>
<p>“This person,” said Milly, in her clear, soft
voice, which her mild eyes, looking at him, made clearer and
softer, “I found soon afterwards. I went back to the
house, and, with Heaven’s help, traced him. I was not
too soon. A very little and I should have been too
late.”</p>
<p>He took his hand from the boy, and laying it on the back of
that hand of hers, whose timid and yet earnest touch addressed
him no less appealingly than her voice and eyes, looked more
intently on her.</p>
<p>“He <i>is</i> the father of Mr. Edmund, the young
gentleman we saw just now. His real name is
Longford.—You recollect the name?”</p>
<p>“I recollect the name.”</p>
<p>“And the man?”</p>
<p>“No, not the man. Did he ever wrong me?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Ah! Then it’s
hopeless—hopeless.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, and softly beat upon the hand he held, as
though mutely asking her commiseration.</p>
<p>“I did not go to Mr. Edmund last night,” said
Milly,—”You will listen to me just the same as if you
did remember all?”</p>
<p>“To every syllable you say.”</p>
<p>“Both, because I did not know, then, that this really
was his father, and because I was fearful of the effect of such
intelligence upon him, after his illness, if it should be.
Since I have known who this person is, I have not gone either;
but that is for another reason. He has long been separated
from his wife and son—has been a stranger to his home
almost from this son’s infancy, I learn from him—and
has abandoned and deserted what he should have held most
dear. In all that time he has been falling from the state
of a gentleman, more and more, until—” she rose up,
hastily, and going out for a moment, returned, accompanied by the
wreck that Redlaw had beheld last night.</p>
<p>“Do you know me?” asked the Chemist.</p>
<p>“I should be glad,” returned the other, “and
that is an unwonted word for me to use, if I could answer
no.”</p>
<p>The Chemist looked at the man, standing in self-abasement and
degradation before him, and would have looked longer, in an
ineffectual struggle for enlightenment, but that Milly resumed
her late position by his side, and attracted his attentive gaze
to her own face.</p>
<p>“See how low he is sunk, how lost he is!” she
whispered, stretching out her arm towards him, without looking
from the Chemist’s face. “If you could remember
all that is connected with him, do you not think it would move
your pity to reflect that one you ever loved (do not let us mind
how long ago, or in what belief that he has forfeited), should
come to this?”</p>
<p>“I hope it would,” he answered. “I
believe it would.”</p>
<p>His eyes wandered to the figure standing near the door, but
came back speedily to her, on whom he gazed intently, as if he
strove to learn some lesson from every tone of her voice, and
every beam of her eyes.</p>
<p>“I have no learning, and you have much,” said
Milly; “I am not used to think, and you are always
thinking. May I tell you why it seems to me a good thing
for us, to remember wrong that has been done us?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That we may forgive it.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, great Heaven!” said Redlaw, lifting up
his eyes, “for having thrown away thine own high
attribute!”</p>
<p>“And if,” said Milly, “if your memory should
one day be restored, as we will hope and pray it may be, would it
not be a blessing to you to recall at once a wrong and its
forgiveness?”</p>
<p>He looked at the figure by the door, and fastened his
attentive eyes on her again; a ray of clearer light appeared to
him to shine into his mind, from her bright face.</p>
<p>“He cannot go to his abandoned home. He does not
seek to go there. He knows that he could only carry shame
and trouble to those he has so cruelly neglected; and that the
best reparation he can make them now, is to avoid them. A
very little money carefully bestowed, would remove him to some
distant place, where he might live and do no wrong, and make such
atonement as is left within his power for the wrong he has
done. To the unfortunate lady who is his wife, and to his
son, this would be the best and kindest boon that their best
friend could give them—one too that they need never know
of; and to him, shattered in reputation, mind, and body, it might
be salvation.”</p>
<p>He took her head between her hands, and kissed it, and said:
“It shall be done. I trust to you to do it for me,
now and secretly; and to tell him that I would forgive him, if I
were so happy as to know for what.”</p>
<p>As she rose, and turned her beaming face towards the fallen
man, implying that her mediation had been successful, he advanced
a step, and without raising his eyes, addressed himself to
Redlaw.</p>
<p>“You are so generous,” he said, “—you
ever were—that you will try to banish your rising sense of
retribution in the spectacle that is before you. I do not
try to banish it from myself, Redlaw. If you can, believe
me.”</p>
<p>The Chemist entreated Milly, by a gesture, to come nearer to
him; and, as he listened looked in her face, as if to find in it
the clue to what he heard.</p>
<p>“I am too decayed a wretch to make professions; I
recollect my own career too well, to array any such before
you. But from the day on which I made my first step
downward, in dealing falsely by you, I have gone down with a
certain, steady, doomed progression. That, I say.”</p>
<p>Redlaw, keeping her close at his side, turned his face towards
the speaker, and there was sorrow in it. Something like
mournful recognition too.</p>
<p>“I might have been another man, my life might have been
another life, if I had avoided that first fatal step. I
don’t know that it would have been. I claim nothing
for the possibility. Your sister is at rest, and better
than she could have been with me, if I had continued even what
you thought me: even what I once supposed myself to
be.”</p>
<p>Redlaw made a hasty motion with his hand, as if he would have
put that subject on one side.</p>
<p>“I speak,” the other went on, “like a man
taken from the grave. I should have made my own grave, last
night, had it not been for this blessed hand.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, he likes me too!” sobbed Milly, under
her breath. “That’s another!”</p>
<p>“I could not have put myself in your way, last night,
even for bread. But, to-day, my recollection of what has
been is so strongly stirred, and is presented to me, I
don’t know how, so vividly, that I have dared to come at
her suggestion, and to take your bounty, and to thank you for it,
and to beg you, Redlaw, in your dying hour, to be as merciful to
me in your thoughts, as you are in your deeds.”</p>
<p>He turned towards the door, and stopped a moment on his way
forth.</p>
<p>“I hope my son may interest you, for his mother’s
sake. I hope he may deserve to do so. Unless my life
should be preserved a long time, and I should know that I have
not misused your aid, I shall never look upon him
more.”</p>
<p>Going out, he raised his eyes to Redlaw for the first
time. Redlaw, whose steadfast gaze was fixed upon him,
dreamily held out his hand. He returned and touched
it—little more—with both his own; and bending down
his head, went slowly out.</p>
<p>In the few moments that elapsed, while Milly silently took him
to the gate, the Chemist dropped into his chair, and covered his
face with his hands. Seeing him thus, when she came back,
accompanied by her husband and his father (who were both greatly
concerned for him), she avoided disturbing him, or permitting him
to be disturbed; and kneeled down near the chair to put some warm
clothing on the boy.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly where it is. That’s
what I always say, father!” exclaimed her admiring
husband. “There’s a motherly feeling in Mrs.
William’s breast that must and will have went!”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” said the old man; “you’re
right. My son William’s right!”</p>
<p>“It happens all for the best, Milly dear, no
doubt,” said Mr. William, tenderly, “that we have no
children of our own; and yet I sometimes wish you had one to love
and cherish. Our little dead child that you built such
hopes upon, and that never breathed the breath of life—it
has made you quiet-like, Milly.”</p>
<p>“I am very happy in the recollection of it, William
dear,” she answered. “I think of it every
day.”</p>
<p>“I was afraid you thought of it a good deal.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say, afraid; it is a comfort to me; it
speaks to me in so many ways. The innocent thing that never
lived on earth, is like an angel to me, William.”</p>
<p>“You are like an angel to father and me,” said Mr.
William, softly. “I know that.”</p>
<p>“When I think of all those hopes I built upon it, and
the many times I sat and pictured to myself the little smiling
face upon my bosom that never lay there, and the sweet eyes
turned up to mine that never opened to the light,” said
Milly, “I can feel a greater tenderness, I think, for all
the disappointed hopes in which there is no harm. When I
see a beautiful child in its fond mother’s arms, I love it
all the better, thinking that my child might have been like that,
and might have made my heart as proud and happy.”</p>
<p>Redlaw raised his head, and looked towards her.</p>
<p>“All through life, it seems by me,” she continued,
“to tell me something. For poor neglected children,
my little child pleads as if it were alive, and had a voice I
knew, with which to speak to me. When I hear of youth in
suffering or shame, I think that my child might have come to
that, perhaps, and that God took it from me in His mercy.
Even in age and grey hair, such as father’s, it is present:
saying that it too might have lived to be old, long and long
after you and I were gone, and to have needed the respect and
love of younger people.”</p>
<p>Her quiet voice was quieter than ever, as she took her
husband’s arm, and laid her head against it.</p>
<p>“Children love me so, that sometimes I half
fancy—it’s a silly fancy, William—they have
some way I don’t know of, of feeling for my little child,
and me, and understanding why their love is precious to me.
If I have been quiet since, I have been more happy, William, in a
hundred ways. Not least happy, dear, in this—that
even when my little child was born and dead but a few days, and I
was weak and sorrowful, and could not help grieving a little, the
thought arose, that if I tried to lead a good life, I should meet
in Heaven a bright creature, who would call me,
Mother!”</p>
<p>Redlaw fell upon his knees, with a loud cry.</p>
<p>“O Thou,” he said, “who through the teaching
of pure love, hast graciously restored me to the memory which was
the memory of Christ upon the Cross, and of all the good who
perished in His cause, receive my thanks, and bless
her!”</p>
<p>Then, he folded her to his heart; and Milly, sobbing more than
ever, cried, as she laughed, “He is come back to
himself! He likes me very much indeed, too! Oh, dear,
dear, dear me, here’s another!”</p>
<p>Then, the student entered, leading by the hand a lovely girl,
who was afraid to come. And Redlaw so changed towards him,
seeing in him and his youthful choice, the softened shadow of
that chastening passage in his own life, to which, as to a shady
tree, the dove so long imprisoned in his solitary ark might fly
for rest and company, fell upon his neck, entreating them to be
his children.</p>
<p>Then, as Christmas is a time in which, of all times in the
year, the memory of every remediable sorrow, wrong, and trouble
in the world around us, should be active with us, not less than
our own experiences, for all good, he laid his hand upon the boy,
and, silently calling Him to witness who laid His hand on
children in old time, rebuking, in the majesty of His prophetic
knowledge, those who kept them from Him, vowed to protect him,
teach him, and reclaim him.</p>
<p>Then, he gave his right hand cheerily to Philip, and said that
they would that day hold a Christmas dinner in what used to be,
before the ten poor gentlemen commuted, their great Dinner Hall;
and that they would bid to it as many of that Swidger family,
who, his son had told him, were so numerous that they might join
hands and make a ring round England, as could be brought together
on so short a notice.</p>
<p>And it was that day done. There were so many Swidgers
there, grown up and children, that an attempt to state them in
round numbers might engender doubts, in the distrustful, of the
veracity of this history. Therefore the attempt shall not
be made. But there they were, by dozens and
scores—and there was good news and good hope there, ready
for them, of George, who had been visited again by his father and
brother, and by Milly, and again left in a quiet sleep.
There, present at the dinner, too, were the Tetterbys, including
young Adolphus, who arrived in his prismatic comforter, in good
time for the beef. Johnny and the baby were too late, of
course, and came in all on one side, the one exhausted, the other
in a supposed state of double-tooth; but that was customary, and
not alarming.</p>
<p>It was sad to see the child who had no name or lineage,
watching the other children as they played, not knowing how to
talk with them, or sport with them, and more strange to the ways
of childhood than a rough dog. It was sad, though in a
different way, to see what an instinctive knowledge the youngest
children there had of his being different from all the rest, and
how they made timid approaches to him with soft words and
touches, and with little presents, that he might not be
unhappy. But he kept by Milly, and began to love
her—that was another, as she said!—and, as they all
liked her dearly, they were glad of that, and when they saw him
peeping at them from behind her chair, they were pleased that he
was so close to it.</p>
<p>All this, the Chemist, sitting with the student and his bride
that was to be, Philip, and the rest, saw.</p>
<p>Some people have said since, that he only thought what has
been herein set down; others, that he read it in the fire, one
winter night about the twilight time; others, that the Ghost was
but the representation of his gloomy thoughts, and Milly the
embodiment of his better wisdom. <i>I</i> say nothing.</p>
<p>—Except this. That as they were assembled in the
old Hall, by no other light than that of a great fire (having
dined early), the shadows once more stole out of their
hiding-places, and danced about the room, showing the children
marvellous shapes and faces on the walls, and gradually changing
what was real and familiar there, to what was wild and
magical. But that there was one thing in the Hall, to which
the eyes of Redlaw, and of Milly and her husband, and of the old
man, and of the student, and his bride that was to be, were often
turned, which the shadows did not obscure or change.
Deepened in its gravity by the fire-light, and gazing from the
darkness of the panelled wall like life, the sedate face in the
portrait, with the beard and ruff, looked down at them from under
its verdant wreath of holly, as they looked up at it; and, clear
and plain below, as if a voice had uttered them, were the
words.</p>
