<p>
  A bloom was spread over the morning sky. A soft golden light bathed with
  its fresh beam the bosom of the valley, except where a delicate haze,
  rather than a mist, still partially lingered over the river, which yet
  occasionally gleamed and sparkled in the sunshine. A sort of shadowy
  lustre suffused the landscape, which, though distinct, was mitigated in
  all its features—the distant woods, the clumps of tall trees that
  rose about the old grey bridge, the cottage chimneys that sent their smoke
  into the blue still air, amid their clustering orchards and garden of
  flowers and herbs.
</p>
<p>
  Ah! what is there so fresh and joyous as a summer morn! That spring time
  of the day, when the brain is bright, and the heart is brave; the season
  of daring and of hope; the renovating hour!
</p>
<p>
  Came forth from his cottage room the brother of Lord Marney, to feel the
  vigorous bliss of life amid sunshiny gardens and the voices of bees and
  birds.
</p>
<p>
  “Ah! this is delicious!” he felt. “This is existence! Thank God I am here;
  that I have quitted for ever that formal and heartless Marney. Were it not
  for my mother, I would remain Mr Franklin for ever. Would I were indeed a
  journalist; provided I always had a mission to the vale of Mowbray. Or
  anything, so that I were ever here. As companions, independent of
  everything else, they are superior to any that I have been used to. Why do
  these persons interest me? They feel and they think: two habits that have
  quite gone out of fashion, if ever they existed, among my friends. And
  that polish of manners, that studied and factitious refinement, which is
  to compensate for the heartlessness or the stupidity we are doomed to—is
  my host of last night deficient in that refinement? If he do want our
  conventional discipline, he has a native breeding which far excels it. I
  observe no word or action which is not prompted by that fine feeling which
  is the sure source of good taste. This Gerard appears to me a real genuine
  man; full of knowledge worked out by his own head; with large yet
  wholesome sympathies; and a deuced deal better educated than Lord de
  Mowbray or my brother—and they do occasionally turn over a book,
  which is not the habit of our set.
</p>
<p>
  “And his daughter—ay, his daughter! There is something almost
  sublime about that young girl, yet strangely sweet withal; a tone so lofty
  combined with such simplicity is very rare. For there is no affectation of
  enthusiasm about her; nothing exaggerated, nothing rhapsodical. Her dark
  eyes and lustrous face, and the solemn sweetness of her thrilling voice—they
  haunt me; they have haunted me from the first moment I encountered her
  like a spirit amid the ruins of our abbey. And I am one of ‘the family of
  sacrilege.’ If she knew that! And I am one of the conquering class she
  denounces. If also she knew that! Ah! there is much to know! Above all—the
  future. Away! the tree of knowledge is the tree of death. I will have no
  thought that is not as bright and lovely as this morn.”
 </p>
<p>
  He went forth from his little garden, and strolled along the road in the
  direction of the cottage of Gerard, which was about three quarters of a
  mile distant. You might see almost as far; the sunshiny road a little
  winding and rising a very slight ascent. The cottage itself was hid by its
  trees. While Egremont was still musing of one who lived under that roof,
  he beheld in the distance Sybil.
</p>
<p>
  She was springing along with a quick and airy step. Her black dress
  displayed her undulating and elastic figure. Her little foot bounded from
  the earth with a merry air. A long rosary hung at her side; and her head
  was partly covered with a hood which descended just over her shoulders.
  She seemed gay, for Harold kept running before her with a frolicsome air,
  and then returning to his mistress, danced about her, and almost
  overpowered her with his gambols.
</p>
<p>
  “I salute thee, holy sister,” said Egremont.
</p>
<p>
  “Oh! is not this a merry morn!” she exclaimed with a bright and happy
  face.
</p>
<p>
  “I feel it as you. And whither do you go?”
 </p>
<p>
  “I go to the convent; I pay my first visit to our Superior since I left
  them.”
 </p>
<p>
  “Not very long ago,” said Egremont, with a smile, and turning with her.
</p>
<p>
  “It seems so,” said Sybil.
</p>
<p>
  They walked on together; Sybil glad as the hour; noticing a thousand
  cheerful sights, speaking to her dog in her ringing voice, as he gambolled
  before them, or seized her garments in his mouth, and ever and anon
  bounded away and then returned, looking up in his mistress’ face to
  inquire whether he had been wanted in his absence.
</p>
<p>
  “What a pity it is that your father’s way each morning lies up the
  valley,” said Egremont; “he would be your companion to Mowbray.”
 </p>
<p>
  “Ah! but I am so happy that he has not to work in a town,” said Sybil. “He
  is not made to be cooped up in a hot factory in a smoky street. At least
  he labours among the woods and waters. And the Traffords are such good
  people! So kind to him and to all.”
 </p>
<p>
  “You love your father very much.”
 </p>
<p>
  She looked at him a little surprised; and then her sweet serious face
  broke into a smile and she said, “And is that strange?”
</p>
<p>
  “I think not,” said Egremont; “I am inclined to love him myself.”
</p>
<p>
  “Ah! you win my heart,” said Sybil, “when you praise him. I think that is
  the real reason why I like Stephen; for otherwise he is always saying
  something with which I cannot agree, which I disapprove; and yet he is so
  good to my father!”
</p>
<p>
  “You speak of Mr Morley—”
</p>
<p>
  “Oh! we don’t call him ‘Mr’,” said Sybil slightly laughing.
</p>
<p>
  “I mean Stephen Morley,” said Egremont recalling his position, “whom I met
  in Marney Abbey. He is very clever, is he not?”
</p>
<p>
  “He is a great writer and a great student; and what he is he has made
  himself. I hear too that you follow the same pursuit,” said Sybil.
</p>
<p>
  “But I am not a great writer or a great student,” said Egremont.
</p>
<p>
  “Whatever you be, I trust,” said Sybil, in a more serious tone, “that you
  will never employ the talents that God has given you against the People.”
</p>
<p>
  “I have come here to learn something of their condition,” said Egremont.
  “That is not to be done in a great city like London. We all of us live too
  much in a circle. You will assist me, I am sure,” added Egremont; “your
  spirit will animate me. You told me last night that there was no other
  subject, except one, which ever occupied your thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
  “Yes,” said Sybil, “I have lived under two roofs, only two roofs; and each
  has given me a great idea; the Convent and the Cottage. One has taught me
  the degradation of my faith, the other of my race. You should not wonder,
  therefore, that my heart is concentrated on the Church and the People.”
</p>
<p>
  “But there are other ideas,” said Egremont, “that might equally be
  entitled to your thought.”
</p>
<p>
  “I feel these are enough,” said Sybil; “too great, as it is, for my
  brain.”
