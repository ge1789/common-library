<p>“Mary!”</p>
<p>It was midnight. A week’s anxious watching over the wandering patient had been terrible work. Although Claude had never been violent, it was heart rending to see his blue eyes without consciousness — to hear him asking piteously for Mary, when her cool hand was laid upon his burning forehead — to feel that this might terminate in death, without another word, even a farewell, from his lips. At length the crisis came. Mary, her hand fast locked in his (for she had refused to leave him, and even in his delirium, and when he did not know her, her touch had a soothing influence upon him) sat with her eyes riveted upon his sleeping face, waiting for the awakening, which might be to death, or to life.</p>
<p>Those only who have watched by the sick-bed of one so dearly beloved can guess what she felt when his eyes, no longer wild, and with that dreadful, unconscious, yet fixed gaze in them, were turned upon her with a look of affectionate recognition — when his voice, so weak as scarcely to be audible, pronounced her name.</p>
<p>She held up her finger — it had been expressly ordered that he should be kept in a state of the most perfect quiet.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” he whispered, in the same faint voice. “I thought I was dying, and that you would not come to me.”</p>
<p>Mary stooped down to kiss his forehead.</p>
<p>“I will not leave you, dearest,” she said; “you are not going to die, I trust.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes again; the overpowering weakness induced slumber. Mary watched him fall from sleep to sleep — the best restorer for his exhausted frame. The morning brought with it fresh and cooling breezes, which lasted many weeks, and brought strength on their wings.</p>
<p>Mr. Grey came in, according to his usual custom, on his way downstairs to breakfast, to inquire how the patient was. The improved tidings brought in Lady Devereux, a stately and grand old lady, who had been softened from her usual calm and haughty indifference by the warm interest which she could not help taking in the poor boy thus thrown upon her compassion, and, in a measure, upon her care.</p>
<p>She came in, bringing with her a fragrance of sweet odours, and a bouquet of flowers, a most cheering and gladdening sight in a sick-room. She gave Mary a very gracious and kindly “good morning,” and stooped down to pat Claude’s cheek encouragingly with her slender, ringed hand.</p>
<p>“I am glad you are better, my poor child,” said the Countess, in her decided, abrupt voice; “if you had died, my poor Claude,” she went on, glancing with a smile at Mary, “it would have ruined the prettiest little romance in the world.”</p>
<p>She had quite made up her mind that Mary was to marry Claude; she appealed now to Mr. Grey for a confirmation of her idea.</p>
<p>“I am not skilled in romance, madam,” he said. Mary looked up at him shyly, and wondered at his cold tone and unmoved glance. She wondered again, as she often did, what could have altered him; he was always very courteously considerate, and scrupulously attentive, so that no one else would have noticed any change; but, ah! how sorely she <i>felt</i> it.</p>
<p>Lady Devereux held out the bouquet to Claude, whose eyes had been following it with a longing glance; he received it gladly; and she took her departure, her ebony cane and high-heeled shoes tapping in measured cadence as she walked along the tesselated floor. The Countess always reminded Mary of the fairy-godmother of Cinderella; and, truly, the gorgeous and stately little old lady, in her soft, thick satins, her jewels, and her powdered hair, was not unlike a magnificent queen-dowager of the fairies. After the crisis was passed, Claude recovered steadily; he had every advantage on his side, and death was cheated of his victim this time. Although comparatively quick, a convalescence from so exhaustive and prolonged a fever must necessarily be a work of time; it was such a pleasant time, though, and every one petted and indulged him so thoroughly, that Mary often told him he was in no haste to get well. When he was well enough to be moved to the sofa in an adjoining room, Lady Devereux heaped round him every comfort and every luxury that was obtainable. And they had very pleasant evenings; all gathering round him, after the labour of the day was finished, and the sultry, oriental heat gone down. Then there were drives, too, in the easiest carriage the Countess’s quick eyes could single out in all Constantinople, and in which Claude, propped up with pillows, with Lady Devereux and Mary opposite to him, ministering to his every want, and indulging his every whim, enjoyed the evening air.</p>
<p>Lady Devereux watched, with very kind and interested eyes, what she fancied to be the progress of her little romance; she had quite scouted from the first her son’s idea of Mary’s being engaged to Henry Hamilton, and at length proceeded to ask her down right if such were the case. She was very triumphant over the answer.</p>
<p>It was thought advisable, in spite of his being so well and kindly taken care of, that Claude should return to England as soon as he was strong enough to bear the voyage. Mary was delighted to find that his anxiety to see again his friends and country (a desire which grew as the hot weather came on, and he longed to feel the English breezes) quite obviated any unwillingness that he might be supposed to have to meet Bertha again. She gathered courage to ask him, a day or two before they were to return, “if he minded seeing her again.”</p>
<p>“Not at all; she has neither power to wound nor to enchant now. The real sufferings of those miserable autumn nights before Sebastopol quite drove all fanciful miseries out of my foolish head; and by this I know it was not real love I felt for Bertha — it was ‘the first impulse of an undisciplined heart.’ I hope, Mary, this illness, and the thoughts that it has brought to me while I have been lying, perhaps apparently asleep, have made me a wiser, if not a sadder man. I think now that I shall see things under a new aspect, and henceforth begin the world again with fresh strength, and with a new sense of the duties and realities of life.”</p>
<p>It was settled that they were to return home in a sailing vessel, in order that Claude might have as much as possible of the sea air. It was probable that Lord Devereux would follow them before many weeks; his mission being in a fair way of coming to a satisfactory conclusion. As to Mr. Grey’s movements, Mary had not the slightest information; she was effectually chilled by his strange reserve, and her pride quite prevented her making any attempt to overcome it, or from trying to guess its cause. She kept out of his way as much as possible, which was not very difficult, as he appeared to be very busy, and never came upstairs until quite late. She tried not to puzzle her head more than she could help with fruitless efforts to remember anything which might have given him cause for offence; her sense of her own innocence, and of his unfounded alteration in manner, made her often very cold and silent to him — and thus the breach widened from day to day; he thinking her weak, possibly false; she judging him to be heartlessly unkind. How many lifelong alienations do such mistakes induce!</p>
<p>But these errors were discovered in time, although they had called forth many a heartache.</p>
<p>The morning of their departure came at length. Lady Devereux was quite low-spirited at the prospect of losing her young friends; she provided everything they could possibly require, or even wish for, and bade them “make haste and finish the last chapter of their little romance.” Claude and Mary had breakfasted downstairs for the first time that morning; they were to go on board directly after that meal. Lady Devereux had selected the very finest flowers in her green-house for a last gift to Claude; she brought them in, and gave the basket containing them to Mary, saying that she “should make them more valuable by arranging them for her cousin with her own little hands.”</p>
<p>Claude watched the operation of grouping them with great interest; he took the pleasure of an invalid in the smallest matters. The last flowers Mary took up were some very fine camellias; Mr. Grey remarked, with a start, Mary with a blush, that they were of the very same delicate, variegated hues as those he had given her.</p>
<p>“These camellias remind me of some thing, Mary,” said Claude, touching them. “What can it be? — Oh! I have it,” he said, presently; “you had flowers like those the night of my birthday, that night I was so unkind to you. I shall never be able to endure the sight of those camellias again. It will remind me of that time, that miserable time, Mary, in the library at Heath House. How ungrateful I was, in ‘refusing to be comforted;’ I believe now that ‘there are many happy days in store for me,’ although I could not see it then. Will you forgive, and try to forget, that unfortunate night?”</p>
<p>Mary held out her hand with tears in her eyes; she took the camellias out of the nosegay, and proceeded to bind it up. Claude drew her down to kiss her; Mr. Grey did not grudge any caresses to Claude now; before, he had watched with jealous eyes even Mary’s looks and words. He saw everything in its true light now.</p>
<p>“Since Claude dislikes them, will you give those flowers to me?”</p>
<p>Mary held them out to him with a very bright flush.</p>
<p>“Claude! Mary!” called Lady Devereux from another room (she and her son had both left the breakfast-table).</p>
<p>My lord says it is quite time for you to be preparing for your departure.”</p>
<p>Claude went at once. Mary lingered half a minute to complete the tying up of his bouquet. Mr. Grey seized her hand as she laid the flowers down.</p>
<p>“Mary! can you, will you, forgive me all my coldness and neglect? Will you trust me, and believe that at our next meeting I can and will explain all that may have appeared unaccountable?”</p>
<p>There was no time to say more; Lady Devereux’s clattering heels and tapping cane were heard just outside; Mary bowed her head, and flushed very deeply. Words she had none; and they were not wanted. She made her escape by another door as the Countess entered.</p>
<p>The farewells were very warm ones; Lady Devereux would not hear any thanks from either Claude or Mary; she told them to “repay her by letting her hear the end of the little romance as soon as possible,” as she kissed them both affectionately.</p>
<p>“We have always been too steady friends to think of each other in that way, Lady Devereux,” said Mary. She could not help a half-shy, half-piquant glance at Mr. Grey, standing by. The little countess’s quick eye caught this expression, and the answering glance, which brought to Mary’s cheek a very charming and tale-telling blush.</p>
<p>“Ah! I shall have a romance all the same,” said Lady Devereux — “with the same heroine, if the hero is different. Ask me to the wedding, my child. Now, adieu!”</p>
<p>Mary was glad that Claude did not hear this triumphant discovery of the little old lady’s. Lord Devereux came up, very opportunely to cover her confusion, to hope, with very sincere and cordial courtesy, “that although he was sorry to hear from his mother that he was not to have the pleasure of becoming a relative, Mary would allow him to consider himself a friend.”</p>
<p>“And now, children, go,” said the Countess, “these prolonged adieus are unnecessarily agitating to my nerves.”</p>
<p>Mr. Grey accompanied them on board, and stayed with them until the last moment, wrapping up Claude with very skilful and tender hands, and seeing that everything was comfortably settled for his convenience, and that of Mary. The warning-bell rang at last.</p>
<p>“Good-bye! Take care of yourself, Claude — I need not tell Mary to take care of you.”</p>
<p>He kissed the little hand Mary held out, with all the devotion of the lovers of chivalry; he had found time to tell her that he would return to England with Lord Devereux, and to add that “he would count the hours until he should see her again.”</p>
<p>Mary, with her hand on Claude’s shoulder, watched Mr. Grey’s figure, conspicuous for its height, and for the upright carriage of his head, until it was but a speck in the distance; a deep joy swelling at her heart.</p>
