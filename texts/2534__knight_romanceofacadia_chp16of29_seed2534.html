<p>“It may be many months, my very dear little Cousin, before I shall have an opportunity of sending this letter to you, but writing seems to bring you nearer to us, even if you are never to see what I have written. It is now more than a year since my father took my last letter with him to Maine, and entrusted it to the Deputy-Governor, who kindly promised to forward it and the accompanying bill of exchange to England, with his next dispatches to the Lord Proprietary. So, probably, before now you may have received tidings of those who so often think of you, and who love you so well, and whom, I think, dear Victoire, you cannot have quite forgotten, but must still love a little. Every time that there is an unusual movement at our landing-place, or that a strange vessel sails into the basin, we hope that you are coming back to us; and when the hope passes away, like all former hopes, we gaze into each others’ blank faces, and see our own disappointment multiplied by three. My father and my mother think that you ought not to stay longer in Scotland. No doubt your friends there would be very sorry to lose you--but, Victoire, your friends in Acadie have also a claim upon you, and no person in Scotland can love you so well as you are loved by at least <i>one</i>, in Acadie. When the good father came back from Agamenticus he brought with him news partly very sorrowful, and partly very joyful. The first made me wish that I had not sent my letter, or that Sir Ferdinando Gorges might never receive it from his son, Or forward it to you. For, poor darling, I am afraid that your sorrows may be all brought back to you by that letter, written when we had only heard of your safe arrival at Leith, and knew nothing of the sad, sad tidings which awaited you there, nor of your after-sufferings. Mr. James’s letter, containing all this painful intelligence, had been long delayed at Boston, and would not have reached us when it did, had not M. de la Tour’s friend, Mr. Samuel Maverick, of Noddle’s Island, charged himself with its transmission to my father, then in Maine. Mr. Maverick also brought to my father the joyful news that M. de la Tour was not killed, as you thought, and as we had thought after we received your letters sent back in the <i>Lady of Wight</i>; but that when his skiff was struck and sank, he was uninjured, and rose again to the surface of the water, behind <i>La Ligue</i>, and in the very midst of the Indian canoes, which you afterwards saw rowing towards the coast. He was then in one of those canoes, having been picked up by the Micmacs, who were going from Sandy Island to St. Peter’s Islands. After staying some time with M. Denis at Cape Breton, he made his way across the land to his fort on the St. John’s River, which he reached soon after Captain Gaston’s return. We have heard nothing about him since my father’s visit to Maine. He is probably shut up in the fort, as Mr. Maverick told the good papa that De Charnisé had succeeded in procuring from the French King, who is badly instructed in Acadian affairs, a revocation of M. de la Tour’s Commission as Lieutenant-General, and an order for his arrest as a traitor. In hopes of being able to execute this wicked order, the Governor was then lying in wait, with a strong force, at the mouth of the St. John. If our good Lieutenant-General should be sent as a prisoner to France, and the supreme power should remain with M. de Charnisé, I think--or, rather, I should say, my father thinks, for my opinion is worth very little--that Acadie will be ruined. During M. de la Tour’s long absence, and since he has been comparatively helpless, the country has suffered greatly. Things are hushed up--persons are afraid to speak--and much happens of which we never hear; but we hear enough to know that Port Royal is full of prisoners, who have been forcibly torn from their homes, for no fault but for venturing to settle in the Governor’s dominions, or perhaps for trading without sufficient regard to what he considers his exclusive privileges. They say that La Have has been almost depopulated, and many smaller settlements have been broken up--some even which were quite out of his boundaries, having been established by M. de la Tour. I believe, however, that the Governor now claims all but M. Denis’s share of Acadie, on the pretence that M. de la Tour’s share has been forfeited. My father says that his great object is to turn the whole country once more into a wilderness--with no inhabitants but the native tribes, and the wild beasts--in order that he may hunt without interruption, and trade without opposition. Oh, Victoire, he is a bad, bad man!</p>
<p>“<i>August 22nd.</i>--There has not yet been any opportunity of sending to Scotland, and I see little hope of any such occurring, as my father now never leaves home, M. de Charnisé having revoked his trade-license. The Governor made boundless professions of regret at being forced to do so by his obligations to the company of the ‘Hundred Associates,’ whose rights of monopoly have been, he said, ‘too freely evaded by the colonists, encouraged by that heretical traitor to his country, Charles de la Tour.’ He pretended not to know that we are ‘heretics’ also, and he spoke of the necessity of enforcing that regulation of the Company which excludes all Huguenots from New France. I am afraid I understand the meaning of all this. Last month he asked me to marry him. For my father’s sake--for all our sakes--I did not dare to tell him how disgusted and indignant I felt, but I told him that I was too young; that I was not ﬁt to be the wife of a man of his exalted rank; that I could not leave my parents. He would not at first take my answer as a positive refusal--evidently fancying that I was only abashed and bewildered by the great honour he had done me; but when he found that I was in earnest, he went away looking as I never saw him look before, and the next day he spoke to the poor little papa as I have told you. Oh, Victoire! What shall we do if he forces us to leave Acadie, as he has forced so many others? It would break my father’s heart! My best hope is that the Canoness is now at Port Royal, and she, I know, will intercede for us. I believe that she has come there to give what help she can to all the unfortunates who are in her brother’s power; and especially to try if she can by any means moderate his rancour against La Tour, who is still closely besieged in his fort. The Canoness frequently visits us, and her visits are a comfort to us all. I feel as if they were the only comfort left to us. When this world is all dark, I suppose it is natural to turn our thoughts to that other world in which all <i>her</i> interests seem to lie. You will fear that she may lead me to embrace her faith; but I do not think so. Certainly, I cannot think ill of a faith which is held by one so saintly; but, on the other hand, M. de la Tour’s mother was of our faith, and she was even more saintly still.</p>
<p>“<i>October 1st.</i>--I have not had the heart to write anything to you, my dear Victoire, for the last two months, but now I feel as if it would kill me not to tell my griefs to any one, and to no one can I tell them but to this paper, which, perhaps, no eyes but mine may ever see. Two months ago I wrote that the world was all dark. I little knew then how much darker it might become. Oh, Victoire! I have said that I will marry him! What will you think of me? What can I think of myself? I hardly know what to think about anything. Everything is confused, there seems to be no clear right or wrong. The Canoness says that there is no real good, excepting in the sacrifice of self. But I do not think it can be right--I know, my cousin, that you do not think it can ever be right to act falsely, whatever good object may be gained by it; and to marry a man whom--but it is done--there is no possibility of drawing back! I have promised to marry him--and--and--oh, Victoire! if I do not marry him he will take away La Petite Rochelle--he will drive my father and mother out of Acadie; they will be beggars--they will starve. You know, my cousin, how the poor father’s heart is bound up in La Petite Rochelle. And, indeed, it is so beautiful! As I write, I look out of my window, and I see the evening sun shining on the orchard--where the trees are laden with the scarlet and crimson fruit--on the bright basin, over which I look across to Port Royal, and up the pretty Laquille, on which we used to paddle our little canoes in those old, old happy days; I think I can almost distinguish the bend into dear Willie’s river ‘Aska,’ where we first saw M. de la Tour, do you remember?--You know this view well, Victoire, and you know how beautiful it is, and how dear to us all. It is not less dear to us than it always has been, but I think if you were to come back to us now you would scarcely recognize La Petite Rochelle. Since my father’s trade has been cut off he has been forced to draw in his expenses, and many of our people have had to leave us. Many of the settlers near the fort--all the Scotch and all the Huguenots--have been driven away to New England, or wherever they can find homes. Those who remain are dull and dispirited, for none know how long they may be left in peace. Much of the land around us is now uncultivated, and weeds are beginning to spring up in the fields where we used to admire the careful husbandry. Our herds are greatly reduced, and it seems to me that even the cattle have a depressed and melancholy look. But oh, Victoire! the worst of all is my father! Do you remember how his laugh used to ring through the frosty air in winter, or his cheerful songs to be borne from a distance on the gentle summer breeze. Do you remember how round and ruddy his face was, and how erect his figure, and how quick and ﬁrm his step? It would make you sad indeed to see him now. It would make your heart ache almost as heavily as mine is aching Whilst I watch him slowly walking down the hill, with his hands clasped listlessly behind him, and his head bent. His head is bent, but that does not hide from me his sunken cheeks, from which all the colour is gone, and his dull, hopeless eyes. He seldom speaks now, and he never laughs. I know that his heart is breaking with the thought that he may shortly be driven out of his Paradise--out of the little settlement which has been the work and the joy of his life, and which he loves as much, I believe, as a mother loves her only child. And my mother,--she is changed too. But you know how she hides everything; how she commands herself. The poor dear father has never byword or look hinted to me that I could save him from the ruin that he dreads--for it is ruin, Victoire; it is not only that he would lose La Petite Rochelle, but that he would lose everything. My mother has said nothing to persuade me--although she has always, as you know, been rather favourably disposed towards the Governor. But the other day she told me--and I felt that she had a motive in telling me--that my dear father was not the object of her first love; that she once nearly broke her heart for love of one whom she knew that she could never marry; that she married my father to please her parents; but that she has known for many years that had she married to please herself she would have been a miserable woman, instead of one of the happiest of wives. Poor mother! She thought this would be encouragement to me; but my dear, good, kind father is very unlike--ah!--I must not write it! --I must not think it! ‘<i>Love, cherish, and obey</i>’--those were the words in M. de la Tour’s little Prayer-book, but I do not know whether the same promise has to be made in the marriage service of the Catholic Church. I never was present at any wedding. Oh, Victoire, Victoire! --he says it must be next month! Good God! that I might die first!</p>
<p>“I must tell you, my cousin:--Charlie is on my lap as I am writing, and when I had written the last few words, my misery took such hold of me that I could bear it no longer, but burst into tears, as though I were still a child. And Charlie got up on his little hind- paws, and licked my face, and whined; he knew that he was to be my ‘<i>comfort</i>’--no, no, I must not! I must never again repeat that word; I must never again think of that time! I must give up Charlie. The Governor hates him. My mother will take care of him when I am gone. Gone! Oh, Charlie! Charlie! I cannot give you up!</p>
<p>“<i>October 20th.</i>--At last there is a chance of this reaching you. Your letter, dated May 20th, has come. Dear, dear little cousin, it is very pleasant to see your handwriting once more, and to learn that you are better. But I wish you said for certain that you are coming back to us. Perhaps some one will come to England and fetch you back to Acadie, though not to us. M. de la Tour’s secretary, or chaplain--I hardly know which he is--brought your letter from Boston. He has been there to ask for aid against M. de la Tour’s enemies, and to propose a free trade between his ports and those of New England. The fifteen years for which the monopoly was granted to the ‘Hundred Associates' have now expired, and M. de la Tour considers that trade should be thrown open to all. This is not likely to conciliate his enemies, who wish to retain the exclusive privileges. He is still a prisoner in his fort. The Boston magistrates have agreed to the free trade, but they have refused him the help he desired of them. The Governor being engaged in blockading the Harbour of St. John, M. Nègre, the envoy, boldly ventured to Port Royal to gain some necessary information, and thus we got our letters. Thus I am, also, able to dispatch this, for he thinks it likely that M. de la Tour may soon send him to England, when he will undertake to deliver it, and, if possible, to see you. He is pressed for time, so I must say good-bye, dearest Victoire. My father and mother send you a thousand kisses. Pity me--there is only a fortnight more. The Canoness says that no one can anticipate or describe the joy of a real sacrifice of self. I do not hope or wish for joy, for myself, but I cannot bear to see my father suffer; and, besides, the Canoness says that her brother’s wife would have more power than she can have to save others who now suffer through him. Therefore I must give up the wish to die. Pray for me, Victoire. We may, perhaps, never meet again, but I shall be always</p>
<p>“Your loving Cousin,</p>
<p>“JEANNE MOTIN.</p>
<p>“I am Jeanne only, now--never again must I be called ‘Marie’!”</p>
