<!-- CHAPTER 2.<br>POOR OLD NEPTUNE -->
<p>‘I can’t understand it; it’s no use trying! I know I’m nothing but a stupid blundering old watch-dog,’ poor Neptune said to himself, and stretched himself out in the stable-yard with a great sigh, and laid down his shaggy head between his paws. Yes, it was no use trying to understand it all; he could make neither head nor tail of this world.</p>
<p>It was a strange thing to him how all the other dogs and beasts about the place seemed able to make out so much more about it than he could. There was Frisk, for instance, the little black-and-white terrier: now Frisk seemed to know everything, and never to be in a moment’s perplexity from morning to night. And what a merry life he led! And there was Juno, the beautiful greyhound, who followed her mistress when she walked about the garden with such a calm, dignified, stately air, as if she were worthy to be the companion of kings and queens, and had no doubt about the matter. And there was Hector, the great Newfoundland, who, big as he was, never seemed (as Neptune always did) to be in anybody’s way — whom every one loved and petted, and who was so good-natured, and so clever too; why, you couldn’t say a word to Hector but he seemed to under stand it; he would listen when his master spoke to him, looking in his face the while for all the world as if he meant to answer him, — as if the very syllables were on his tongue, and the only sorrow he ever had was the sorrow that he couldn’t utter them. <i>Hector</i> didn’t find the world a strange, confused, perplexing place, like poor old Neptune. It was all very smooth and very pleasant to him, and quite as comprehensible as there was any need for it to be. And he would shrug his shoulders when Neptune now and then would try to tell him how sad and bewildering <i>he</i> found it, and would think to himself (though he never <i>said</i> it, for he was both a very well-bred and a kind-hearted dog, who never liked to hurt other people’s feelings), that the old fellow must really be falling into his dotage to talk such stuff.</p>
<p>But Neptune was not falling into his dotage: it was not that. He had never been a bit brighter than he was at present, or almost a bit handsomer; and he certainly was not handsome now. He had a rusty brownish-black coat, without any gloss upon it, — a rough, dusty, ill-kept coat, that had been allowed to take care of itself all its life, and had succeeded in that business very badly indeed. And he had a broad stiff back, and short thick legs, with one of them a little shorter than the other three, for he had fallen into trouble one day when he was very young, and had lamed himself for life, and at the same time had lost the better half of one of his ears. You see he had no beauty at all to boast of. I don’t think any body, however well inclined, could have looked at him, and have said anything civil about him whatever, except that he had a good honest face. He certainly <i>had</i> that — as honest a face as you ever saw in your life. And yet it was a very sad face, too, for it had no brightness in it, but was all full of perplexity, and dull bewilderment and wistfulness, as if he knew quite well (as, indeed, he did) what a stupid, ugly, awkward dog he was, and could, sorrowfully, never make out why it should be so. And he always looked as if he were trying to understand the things that went on about him (which was true too); and as if he were trying to ask questions with his stupid, patient, loving eyes, though knowing all the time, and being quite hopeless about it, that he should never get any answers to them.</p>
<p>Neptune passed his time almost entirely in the stable-yard. That was his proper place, he knew; and though he got tired of it sometimes, and some times, when he had the chance, would trot away for an hour or two — perhaps down as far as the village to see what was going on there, or, if the day was hot, it might be only as far as to the road outside the lodge gates, where a good many people passed up and down, — yet he was generally glad enough after a while to come back again to the place he knew best; for the outer world never treated him very kindly, and if at home he was roughly treated too at times, still it <i>was</i> home, where he had a right to be, which nobody disputed. And so he would lay himself down again contentedly, when he returned from any of these wandering expeditions, in his kennel in the stable-yard; and whenever any of the stable-men passed near him would wag his short bunchy tail at them in a friendly way, as much as to say, ‘I’m glad to be home again; after all, this is the best place for me!’ — sometimes for hours together; though very likely nobody would ever take the least notice of him all the time. But he was quite used to no one taking any notice of him. Everybody took notice of Juno and Hector and Frisk, but poor old Neptune might wag his tail at people, and look up in their faces the whole day long, and it was a chance if any one so much as ever once gave him a single kind word in return.</p>
<p>There are a great many sorts of dogs in the world, you know, just as there are a great many sorts of people. Now Neptune, and those three dogs who lived with him (or near him rather, for Frisk was the only one of them who gave him much of his company), were all four as unlike one another as they could possibly be; and, though on the whole they got on in a friendly enough way together, they thought and felt so differently about most matters that I don’t think you could easily have found any single subject upon which Hector and Juno and Frisk would have entirely come to the same conclusion, with the sole exception that they all agreed in what they thought of Neptune. They could always talk of him with such entire unanimity that it was perfectly delightful.</p>
<p>Of course they all looked down upon him.</p>
<p>‘I really cannot see what such creatures can have been brought into the world for,’ Juno would say superciliously, flinging back her small sleek head. ‘The mere thought of existence in such a shape makes me shudder!’ And then she would quiver all over her delicate body, and pretend that she couldn’t possibly help it (which was a piece of affectation that took in nobody).</p>
<p>‘Well, his ugliness is bad enough,’ Frisk would strike in with next; ‘but even that isn’t so objectionable to me as his stupidity. I don’t set up for being anything very clever myself,’ Frisk would say demurely (just as if he supposed the others would believe him), ‘I don’t set up for being anything very clever myself; but when you’re expected to associate with a dog that has no brains <i>at all</i>, you know, — upon my word, it’s a little too much!’</p>
<p>‘It certainly is one of the strangest cases I ever knew,’ Hector perhaps would remark thoughtfully after this. ‘A better-natured creature, I believe, never lived; but any other dog so entirely devoid of all attractiveness, either of mind or body, I for one unquestionably never came across.’</p>
<p>Yet, though they were thus completely agreed in their opinion of him, they did not by any means all treat him quite in the same way. Juno always behaved to him in the haughtiest manner imaginable, but the other two, each according to his own fashion, were not unkind to him. Indeed Frisk, though he professed, and felt too, the greatest contempt for him, belonged to that class of very lively little dogs who would rather have any company than none; and so, whenever Hector and Juno were out of reach, or sleepy, or disinclined to have a game, you might be sure that in a very little while you would see Frisk come racing up to Neptune in the stable-yard, and, though he pretended to be so terribly impatient of the poor old dog’s stupidity, the truth was that there were not many things he liked better than to show off his sharp wits before him, and let him see what a fine clever young dog he was; which, indeed, poor Neptune perceived clearly enough, and wondered over it excessively, puzzling his poor old brains day after day over that sad question of why <i>he</i> should be so unlike all the other dogs about him, till, quite hopeless and bewildered, he would lay himself down at last, and put his muddled old head down upon his paws, feeling that he couldn’t understand the reason of anything, and that there was nothing for him to do but to give it all up as a bad job.</p>
<p>He had just resigned himself to this conclusion to day, and had shut his eyes, as he lay in the sunshine, to try and sleep away his troubles, when one of the few pleasures that fell at rare intervals in his way chanced suddenly to come to him. His master had a little son of five or six years old — a fine little fellow, whom every body liked about the place, and who liked everybody and everything, down even to old Neptune. They did not let him come often into the stable-yard, but when ever he <i>did</i> come in he was sure to canter up to where Neptune was, and stroke his shaggy, rough head, and get astride upon his back, and try to teach him (though all in vain, for the foolish old dog, strive as he would, could never learn, or even so much as guess, what in the world it was that he was wanted to do) to give a paw and shake hands. There was nothing that Neptune loved so much as he did the sight of little Harry coming careering through the yard. If ever the poor, pathetic face looked bright, it looked bright then, and he would run up to the far end of his chain (if he happened to be chained, and he mostly was), and would stand there wagging his imperfect tail till you would have thought he wanted to wag it off, and pawing the ground with his impatient feet, and writhing his stiff back, and giving short, sharp barks and yelps that were meant for loving calls and words of welcome.</p>
<p>The little lad came into the yard to-day, holding his father’s hand, and skipping about him, and chattering away as fast as his little tongue could go; and as soon as ever he saw him, up sprang old Neptune and set his tail going. ‘Oh, Master Harry!’ he began to say, in his dog’s language, ‘I am so glad you have come! Oh, dear Master, I love you so much! Oh, little Master, take me out with you, as you did that one day long ago, and we’ll roll about together in the fields upon the soft green grass. Little Master! dear little Master! take me with you, for I love you so!’ And in this way he went on, over and over again.</p>
<p>But he had only the faintest shadow of a forlorn hope that Harry had come to take him out with him. That was a thing that had only happened once already in all his life, and he really hardly believed, though he kept asking for it continually, that it would ever happen again. So when Harry came to him, and merely began to talk to him, and pat his head and pinch his ears, and so on, in the usual way, he was not particularly disappointed, but set himself cheerfully to make the most of what was given him, like a sensible and wise old dog. He was not going out into the fields. Well, that was hardly to have been expected; but at least he had what was next best to that — he had beside him, for the moment at least, the creature who was kindest to him in all the world. And so, though Harry only stayed with him for five minutes, that little visit was enough to make all the rest of the day quite bright to Neptune. He lay in his place after his little master had gone, and thought, ‘Perhaps he will come back to-morrow! Who knows but that he may come back to-morrow and take me out with him! If I could but learn that strange thing that he tries to teach me about my paws, I do think he would come oftener. Oh, I wish I could find out what he wants! I wonder if I could find it out if I were to lie quite still here, and try to think!’ said Neptune to himself. And with that he settled himself in a comfortable position, and shut his eyes, that no thing might distract his attention while he gave himself up to meditation; and the result was that in ten minutes the thick-headed, dull old dog was fast and placidly asleep, dreaming perhaps of little Harry far away, and the green fields.</p>
<p>He had wondered if Harry would come back tomorrow, but he little guessed, either he or anybody, what was going to happen before that morrow came. It might have been four or five hours after the little lad had been in the stable-yard, when Neptune, having had his sleep out, began to be aware that something strange was going on around him. People were running to and fro, and speaking in loud voices to one another, and seeming to be in great excitement and distress. After a little while his master (not little Harry, but Harry’s father) came into the stable-yard with Hector following him, and as soon as Neptune saw him he began to wag his tail, for his master would generally give a kind word to him when he came his way; but it was evident, after a moment or two, even to dull Neptune, that he was too much absorbed in something to speak to him or any other dog now. He was not even taking the least notice of Hector, who was walking behind him with his tail drooping on the ground, and his anxious eyes upon his master’s face; walking so slowly and sadly that Neptune felt certain <i>he</i> knew all about it, whatever it was, and had already settled in his own mind that it was a very bad business indeed; which distressed Neptune very deeply, for he had a great respect for what Hector thought.</p>
<p>However, Hector’s understanding of the matter did not help <i>him</i>, for he could not get at Hector to speak to him, and it was quite in vain that he puzzled his old brains to try from anything that was going on to guess what had happened. All he could do was to stand looking about him wistfully; and when, after a time, everybody had left the yard, and things seemed to be comparatively quiet again, there was no choice for him but to settle down once more upon his straw, and try as usual to doze away the time.</p>
<p>He had hardly, however, been lying quiet for more than ten minutes, when the sound of some fresh voices made him prick up his ears again, and, getting on his feet, he saw a couple of men, one of whom he did not know, come into the stable-yard, and, which was very strange, come straight up to <i>him</i>. One of them was a servant of his master; the other, as he saw with no small alarm, was a tall young man, dressed in a tightly- fitting frock-coat, with a shiny hat, like some people whom Neptune had noticed at times when he took his walk down to the village, and had perceived doing strange things there now and then to disorderly persons, and even, on more than one occasion, to disorderly and wandering dogs; very strange and alarming sort of men, several dogs of his acquaintance had described them to him as being, and had warned him on all occasions to keep well out of their way, — a piece of advice which Neptune had hitherto most rigidly followed. Here, however, was one of them come to <i>him</i>, and the poor old dog’s heart began to beat a good deal faster than usual as he got hurriedly upon his legs, and wondered what in the world was going to befall him.</p>
<p>They came straight up to him, the servant speaking as they came.</p>
<p>‘Of course we can try,’ he was saying; ‘but I suspect we shall make nothing of it, for a stupider old beast than he is I never knew, — though he was fond of Master Harry too; there’s no doubt of that. — Come, Neptune!’ he called out suddenly. ‘Neptune! old fellow! wake up and get your wits about you!’ And with that he began to clap Neptune on the back so vigorously that the dull old dog, quite amazed at being taken so much notice of, did not know how to caper and yelp and wag his short tail enough to show his appreciation of such an unexpected compliment. He looked very ridiculous, poor stupid old fellow, as he went leaping and frisking about with his stiff awkward body; but the men seemed to be too full of their own thoughts to laugh at him.</p>
<p>All at once the stranger came forward, and taking him by the muzzle turned his head towards him.</p>
<p>‘Here, Neptune! here, good dog!’ he said, and put something under Neptune’s nose, which Neptune for a moment thought was something to eat, and in his excitement had almost gobbled up without pausing to examine it, when luckily, as he was in the very act of snapping at it, he discovered his mistake. Something to eat! No, no. What a stupid fellow he was! Why, it was, — let him smell it one moment! — to be sure it was, a bit of Master Harry’s clothes. He gave one sniff at it and knew it quite well. It was Master Harry’s little red scarf, and he took it in his mouth softly and tenderly, and then dropped it on the ground and placed his paw upon it, and looked into the men’s faces and wagged his tail, and tried hard to say, with his wistful old face, ‘Yes, yes, I understand this so far; but what do you want me to do next?’</p>
<p>Well, the men wanted him next to go with them, it appeared, for one of them took up the little scarf again from the ground and began to walk away with it, holding it high in the air and calling Neptune after him, and, perplexed though he was, right glad, of course, was Neptune to follow, and they all three left the stable- yard together; and leaping and gamboling, and half beside himself with puzzled delight, Neptune scampered by the men’s side to the lodge gate, refreshing himself with many a loving sniff at the little scarf, and feeling all in the dark, but quite happy nevertheless, — thinking that perhaps they were taking him to his little master, and that that long-expected ramble in the fields was going to come off at last, — until they passed the lodge and reached the open gates into the road; and then all at once the two men stood still, and the stranger threw the little scarf once more to Neptune, and then began to urge him forward and to talk to him, and to make all kinds of bewildering signs, not a single one of which could the old dog understand. He stood eagerly looking in the strange man’s face, leaping now a few steps to the right hand, now a few steps to the left, wondering so why the man did not go on and lead the way, trying with such dumb, earnest patience to find out what it all meant, desiring so to do what the men required from him, and failing so entirely, in his utter blindness of mind, to guess what in the world it could be.</p>
<p>For several minutes he could not guess it, could not conceive what all this pointing and gesticulating and smelling could be for; and then suddenly, at last, when he was almost in despair, and when the men, he knew, were nearly out of patience with him, a vague, dim notion of what it meant flashed into his poor old head. They wanted <i>him</i> to take them to little Harry! Was that it? Was <i>he</i> to go and find him out? Why, if that was all, to be sure he would! Little Harry would be somewhere about the fields, no doubt; those happy fields where they had gone once together. He would find him for them in half a dozen minutes. Was that right, masters? With a joyful bark away he scampered, looking behind him now and then to call the men on. He was by no means quite sure yet that this was what they really wanted from him; but it was such a great step to have found out what might <i>possibly</i> be the thing they wanted that his spirits, which had been sadly depressed for a little while, rose again delightfully as he bounded along the road, and every time he looked back they became still more buoyant, for the quickened steps of the men, and the cheerful words of encouragement that they kept calling out to him, soon made him almost certain that he had actually hit on the right thing to do at last.</p>
<p>So on and on he ran, as fast as his legs would carry him, backwards and forwards (for of course he ran far faster than the men could walk, and so he was obliged continually to turn round again and retrace his steps that he might even keep them in sight), in a state of prodigious excitement.</p>
<p>‘We shall be with him immediately. Follow me! I know all about it. Just up this lane now, and then turn round to the right, — and a little bit up the hill and there we are!’ he barked out over and over again to the two men behind him ; and it seemed to him that they understood every bark he gave, for the farther he went they followed him the faster and faster. So delightful a race Neptune thought that he had never had.</p>
<p>Another minute now and he should be at little Harry’s side! Yes, these were the fields; here was the stile where they went in; now up the little bit of rising ground, and —</p>
<p>He had got to the height whence all the wide field where they once had played together could be seen; but the field was empty; there was no Harry there. He looked all round; no, not a creature there; nothing but the bright summer sunshine lying on the green grass.</p>
<p>He stood stock-still and gave a great sorrowful bark, then turned about and looked in the men’s faces, who were following close behind, thinking that perhaps <i>they</i> would know what to do now; but, alas! they knew nothing; he saw that in a moment: he must find little Harry without any help from them. But how in the world was he to find him? He was a stupid old dog, you know, and all that it came into his head to do at first was to run headlong round and round the field, barking with all his might, and poking his nose into every sort of unlikely place, on the bare chance of little Harry being hid in one of them. But of course he was not; and then, when far or wide he could not see a sign of him, and when, coming slowly back to the men, he saw them standing still and looking as if they did not know which way to turn, then at last a feeling of dread and terror crept into the dog’s heart, and the whole truth at length began to dawn upon him that little Harry’s whereabouts was not only unknown to these particular persons who wanted him, but that everybody was looking for little Harry, and that he was lost. Neptune had heard stories of such things before now; he had heard of little children straying away and losing themselves in woods, or being stolen by naughty men and women, and how whole parties of people would go out to look for them, and would search and search for days, and sometimes never find them, or find them only when they were dying with hunger and cold. Such things had often happened, he had been told: oh, little Master Harry, dear little Master, was it going to happen to you?</p>
<p>What could old Neptune do? He had been round and round the field, and it was quite clear that Harry was not there; where could he look for him next? He looked up wistfully into the men’s faces for some instruction or advice, but they had none to give him. They had plainly lost all the little confidence they had ever had in him, and were talking together with out paying heed to him any more. Should he run round the field once again, just for a last chance? Not much use in doing it, he knew; yet he could do nothing else that he could think off, so off he set. A slow trot all round, snuffing the ground as he went, poking his head through every opening in the hedge — but all in vain ; until the circuit was nearly made, when suddenly the men, who were walking away back to the stile by which they had entered the field, heard a sharp bark, and, turning round at the sound of it, there was Neptune with his ears erect and his back legs stretched stiffly out behind him, snuffing and joy fully barking at something before him, with all his might. They whistled to him to come to them, but their whistling only made him turn his head round for a moment; so then they went to him; and when they came quite close they saw that he had got his paws over a little crumpled soiled child’s glove. A single solitary glove, and nothing more; but as soon as the men caught sight of it they got almost as much excited as Neptune was himself.</p>
<p>‘He must have been here, that’s certain!’ they exclaimed. ‘The dog would never take any notice of it if this wasn’t the little fellow’s glove. Bravo, Neptune! on with you, old dog! Yes, through the hedge; here’s a gap; he’s as likely to have gone this way as any other.’ Neptune was through the hedge already; and away, full speed, the men went after him.</p>
<p>And then such a race began! I am afraid, if the truth must be told, that Neptune knew very little indeed where he was going; his scent (if indeed in this case there was any scent to follow) was not of the keenest, and his wit at no time was of the brightest; but he had to find little Harry; that one fact he had at last got fairly fixed in his cloudy old brain, and he knew that he must go on looking for him as long as he had a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>So away he went, scouring the country right and left, — now for a couple of minutes dashing off in one direction, now taking a fresh course and going like an arrow right ahead, now doubling, and coming pelting back again headlong, all without the slightest plan, — and alas! without the slightest result either. There was no little Harry far or wide to be seen; not even so much as another glove of little Harry’s.</p>
<p>They had been out now for a long time; old Neptune did not know how long it was, but the two men did, and were beginning to get very tired, and rather out of temper. Of course, too, they saw quite well that, though Neptune might be lucky enough to hit upon a discovery by chance, he was far too stupid a dog really to know at all where he was taking them, and they felt that they had probably all this time been going on a very wild-goose chase. So at last they said to one another that as the evening was so warm they thought they had better take a rest now, and try and find some place where they could get a draught of beer, and they whistled to Neptune and took their way to a little roadside inn which was not far off, where they called for what they wanted, and sat down at a little table before the door to drink it.</p>
<p>Their walk had been a rough one, and, as you may suppose, their boots bore marks of it, for they were all covered with mud and clay.</p>
<p>‘You seem to have had a pretty good tramp of it to-day,’ the landlord said to them, as he stood lounging at the door smoking his pipe.</p>
<p>‘I’ll warrant you we have!’ they answered; and they began to tell him what they had been about.</p>
<p>Before they had finished their story the landlord was standing quite erect, and had taken the pipe from his mouth.</p>
<p>‘What kind of a little lad was he?’ he asked. ‘Had he a sort of a tartan petticoat on him, and a cock’s feather, or something that way, in his cap?’</p>
<p>‘To be sure he had!’ cried the men, and they started to their feet.</p>
<p>‘Then I’ll wager that he’s a little chap I saw not above an hour ago!’ said the landlord. And then he told them how, coming home from market across the country a while before, he had seen a little fellow in the company of a man and woman who seemed to be scolding him, and taking him along with them against his will. ‘They were a rough-looking pair,’ he said, ‘and I had my misgivings at the time that they were up to some mischief; but the business was none of mine, so I kept a quiet tongue in my head. However, if the little boy was the one you’re looking for, you’ll have a good chance of coming up with him still, for they were getting along slow enough with him. I’ll tell you now where I saw them.’ And then he gave them the best directions that he could as to the road they were to take; and in another minute, full of hope, the men had started once more, with Neptune (who was sure from their manner that <i>something</i> had been heard of little Harry at last, though of course he could not guess what it was) joyfully following at their heels.</p>
<p>Away they went — off the highroad again, straight across the fields, wasting no time now in looking either to the right hand or the left. There was a clump of trees far ahead on a rising ground that they had to make for first. Well, they got to these after a brisk walk. Then they followed a footpath down into a little wood, and then they went through the wood, and on the farther side of it crossed another field. And then the question came — what should they do next? for it was just at this point that the landlord had caught his last sight of the child. There was a lane turning from the field on one side, and a path running across the field on the other, and who could tell which of these two they ought to take?</p>
<p>Certainly neither of the <i>men</i> could. But <i>Neptune</i>, for some reason or other, very decidedly preferred the lane to the field path, and while the men stood hesitating, away he trotted down it; and the two men, glad to be guided by anything, whether beast or fellow-creature, turned their backs also upon the field, and followed where Neptune led.</p>
<p>But alas for the weary feet that plunged on through miry lanes, and plodded along vainly on their fruitless search! The summer day had been a couple of hours from ending when they left the inn, but when the sun had set and the twilight had come on they were still as much at sea as they had ever been. The men had lost their way, and had got tired and spiritless; trusting to Neptune’s guidance, they had been making a great circuit, and had just found themselves again at a point which they had left an hour ago; it was getting dark, and they were footsore and hungry. What more could they do? As for continuing the search after nightfall, that was out of the question; besides, some of the other parties that were out might have been more lucky than themselves, and by this time the boy might have been found; they had better make their way home again, they decided, and learn there how matters stood. So they turned them about, and whistled to the dog to follow them.</p>
<p>But little did they know of Neptune’s nature, and of his patient, brave, enduring, loving heart. He stood still for a moment when they called him, and turned and looked up in their faces. ‘What — go home, and give up looking for little Harry!’ his look said, and then he gave a great wild bark, and bounded away — fast, out of their sight, lest they should try to get at him and hold him — away like the wind again over hill and dale. For what did <i>he</i> care though his unaccustomed legs were stiff with running, and his tongue was swollen and dry, and his eyes bloodshot? He only knew that little Harry was lost, and that, let who would go home, for <i>him</i> there was no going home again till he had thrust his black old muzzle once more into his little master’s hand — till his old eyes had looked once more in little Harry’s face.</p>
<p>So he ran on still in his wild way — here and there, backwards and forwards, searching in every impossible hole and corner, like the stupid old dog he was, as though Harry had been a rabbit or a rat instead of a little lad of six years old (but it was better to make sure, Neptune thought patiently, for this was such a strange world that there was no saying <i>where</i> little Harry might not be hid); and, ashamed to go home without him, the men still unwillingly followed behind.</p>
<p>But the end was near at hand now. A few minutes longer, — and then suddenly, as Neptune was a little way ahead, all at once they heard an eager yelping sound, a hurried crackling of the brushwood in the nearest hedge, and then a loud wild joyous bark.</p>
<p>‘He’s found him!’ the men cried, and started forward as if they had not walked a step that day.</p>
<p>And so he had. The long day’s search at last was ended. The old dog’s happy eyes had looked once more on the little master that he loved. There he was, crouching at the bottom of that steep bank.</p>
<p>‘Little Master, I have found you!’ he cried out, in his doggish tongue. And with that joyful greeting on his faithful lips he fell bleeding on the ground; for, as he leapt the bank, the man who had stolen little Harry turned sharply round, and, with a gun that was in his hand, shot the old dog through the back.</p>
<hr>
<p>‘Oh, Cousin Trix!’ exclaimed little Mabel, and burst out crying.</p>
<p>‘Are you sorry for old Neptune?’ said Cousin Trix. ‘Well, little Harry, I can tell you, was sorry too.’</p>
<hr>
<p>He broke away from the woman who was trying to hold him, and threw himself upon the ground, sobbing, by his side. ‘Oh, Neptune, my old Neptune, my dear old Neptune!’ he cried out, and he threw his arms about the dog’s neck, and sobbed aloud, and pressed his curly head against the poor old heart. I don’t think they two thought of anything but one another for a whole minute or more, even though the other four people were all fighting at their backs in a way that would have made anybody frightened; for the man who had shot Neptune was a poacher, and when Harry’s servant and the policeman came up he fought like a wild beast, and he was so strong, and the woman did so much to help him, that after a sharp struggle they were glad to let them both escape, and quite content merely to have rescued little Harry out of their hands, for they did not do even that without a hard fight for it. However, it was all over in the course of a minute, and then they had time to breathe, and think of the poor old dog.</p>
<p>He was lying quite still all this time, with his eyes open, but not able to move a bit, except just to give a very little wag to the end of his short tail now and then, as if to say that nobody need be sorry for him, for that he knew it was all quite right; and now and then he put out his tongue, and gave a feeble grateful lick or two to little Harry’s hands.</p>
<p>And now they began to think what they were to do with him, and how they were to get him and Harry home, for though he had been nothing all his life but a stupid dull old dog, and though both the men believed that he was dying, I don’t think either of them would have left him there to die alone, poor men as they were, if you had offered them five pounds. So one of them took off his coat, and, lifting the poor old fellow on it (which, however, was a hard business to do, tenderly though they tried to touch him), they took him up and carried him between them, as in a hammock; and in this way, with sobbing little Harry by their side, they got back to the high-road once more, and in a few minutes after that to a house by the roadside, where the people willingly took them in, and let poor wounded Neptune lie down on the hearth, while one of the men went on as fast as he could run to carry the glad news home.</p>
<p>How they met him there, and how they received his tidings, you may fancy for yourselves, Children. In half an hour after they had been told them little Harry’s father had leaped down from horse-back at the cottage door, and had got his little son clasped close in his arms. And then, with Harry’s hand in his, he went down on his knees by Neptune’s side on the cottage floor. ‘My brave old dog! My faithful, loving, noble dog!’ he said, and burst into tears over the old shaggy head that with all its love could not lift itself now in answer to one kind word.</p>
<hr>
<p>‘But, Cousin Trix, he wasn’t really dying, was he?’ cried Jack, in a tone of some excitement.</p>
<p>And Cousin Trix paused for a moment, and then gave a little smile, and said —</p>
<p>They thought at first that his back was quite broken, and that he certainly couldn’t live, but Harry’s father had the first dog-doctor that was to be found in all the country brought to him, and he examined him carefully, and found where the bullet had lodged, and took it out; and then declared that, for all that had happened yet, old Neptune might live, and get upon his legs again.</p>
<p>And so he did. He never afterwards perhaps was quite as strong as he had been before he was shot, but still, upon the whole, he recovered quite as well as could have been expected; and after he had been carefully nursed for a long time, and after everybody had been very kind to him, at last one day he went quietly back to his kennel in the stable-yard.</p>
<hr>
<p>‘Back to the stable, — after what he had done! Oh, Cousin Trix!’ cried several of the children together, quite indignantly.</p>
<p>‘Well, children, what would you have had?’ asked Cousin Trix. ‘He wasn’t a drawing-room dog, you know; he wasn’t even a dog fit to have with you in the garden, for, try as they would, nobody could ever teach him the difference between the flower-beds and the walks, and he would do more harm in half an hour than the gardener could repair in a couple of days. No; the stable-yard was his proper place, and to the stable-yard he went back when his nursing was ended, and fell once more quite quietly into his old life. Only, I think, it was a happier life than he had ever led before, for every body, from this time onward, was very kind to the old dull awkward dog, and kindest of all were his master and little Harry. There never was a day after his illness that Harry did not come to see him, and many a brave scamper in the fields did he get with the companion that he loved so well. What it all meant, and why people should take more notice of him now than they had done in former days, he never rightly understood to the end of his life; it was to him one of the many mysteries of the world, — but a happy mystery, over which he would brood in grateful dreamy content as he dozed away many a sunny afternoon on the cool stones of the stable-yard.</p>
<p>‘And so he lived for two or three more years, until he had reached a green old age, and his loving eyes grew dim; but even then, — when he was too deaf to hear when other voices called, and too blind to notice other faces near him, — he knew Harry’s face and Harry’s voice, and would joyfully rouse himself to answer a single stroke of the hand that might be given him, or a single kind word that might be spoken to him by the young master whom he had loved from first to last more than his own life.’</p>
<hr>
<p>‘Cousin Trix,’ said one of the children next after noon, ‘do you ever tell fairy stories?’</p>
<p>Cousin Trix had good-naturedly come up to the schoolroom again to-day, to play with the ill-used little creatures there in the twilight, and one of them put this question to her before she had been many minutes in the room. It had very much the air of having been arranged amongst them beforehand, for as soon as Daisy (it was Daisy who acted as spokeswoman) began to open her lips, all the other three stood still with their eyes intent on Cousin Trix’s face.</p>
<p>‘I daresay I have told fairy stories in my day, Daisy,’ replied Cousin Trix. ‘Why do you ask?’ And she looked at Daisy so innocently, that Daisy was quite taken in, and really believed that Cousin Trix couldn’t guess what she had in her mind.</p>
<p>So then she began rather a roundabout explanation, to the effect that she was very fond of fairy stories, and so was Mabel, and so, she thought, was Roger; and Jack <i>used</i> to be fond of them a year or two ago, and she dared say that in reality he was yet; and that they hadn’t had a new book of fairy tales for ever so long, and were quite tired of the old ones — which, indeed, were almost torn to tatters, too, they had been read so very much; — and so (here Daisy began at last to come to the kernel of the business) if Cousin Trix was really in the habit of telling fairy stories, and thought that she could do it pretty well, Daisy would be very well pleased, and so would Queen Mab, and Roger, and even Hercules, if she would sit down and begin to tell one now.</p>
<p>‘Very well, Daisy,’ responded Cousin Trix, who had had full time during Daisy’s prosy speech to get her ideas in order; and, dropping into a seat, she instantly began—</p>
<p>‘There was once a little girl—’</p>
<p>‘Oh, stop a moment, Cousin Trix!’ shouted both the boys, and Daisy looked quite confounded at this rapid fulfilment of her request, and at the precipitate way in which Cousin Trix was proceeding.</p>
<p>‘Wait till we sit down!’ ‘How can you do things so quickly?’ ‘One would think you went about with stories on the tip of your tongue!’ cried the several children loudly.</p>
<p>‘And why <i>shouldn’t</i> I go about with stories on the tip of my tongue?’ inquired Cousin Trix quite coolly.</p>
<p>But at this the children stared, and made no answer; so Cousin Trix laughed, and seeing that they were now all seated, she once more began her tale.</p>
