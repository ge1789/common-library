<title>Chapter 27 of Shirley by Charlotte Brontë</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- CHAPTER XXVII.<br> THE FIRST BLUESTOCKING.-->

<p>Miss Keeldar and her uncle had characters that would
not harmonize, that never had harmonized. He was irritable,
and she was spirited. He was despotic, and she liked
freedom. He was worldly, and she, perhaps, romantic.</p>

<p>Not without purpose had he come down to Yorkshire.
His mission was clear, and he intended to discharge it conscientiously.
He anxiously desired to have his niece
married, to make for her a suitable match, give her in
charge to a proper husband, and wash his hands of her
for ever.</p>

<p>The misfortune was, from infancy upwards, Shirley and
he had disagreed on the meaning of the words “suitable”
and “proper.” She never yet had accepted his definition;
and it was doubtful whether, in the most important step
of her life, she would consent to accept it.</p>

<p>The trial soon came.</p>

<p>Mr. Wynne proposed in form for his son, Samuel Fawthrop
Wynne.</p>

<p>“Decidedly suitable! most proper!” pronounced Mr.
Sympson. “A fine unencumbered estate, real substance,
good connections. <em>It must be done!</em>”</p>

<p>He sent for his niece to the oak parlour; he shut himself
up there with her alone; he communicated the offer; he
gave his opinion; he claimed her consent.</p>

<p>It was withheld.</p>

<p>“No; I shall not marry Samuel Fawthrop Wynne.”</p>

<p>“I ask why. I must have a reason. In all respects he
is more than worthy of you.”</p>

<p>She stood on the hearth. She was pale as the white
marble slab and cornice behind her; her eyes flashed large,
dilated, unsmiling.</p>

<p>“And <em>I</em> ask in what sense that young man is worthy
of <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“He has twice your money, twice your common sense,
equal connections, equal respectability.”</p>

<p>“Had he my money counted fivescore times I would take
no vow to love him.”</p>

<p>“Please to state your objections.”</p>
    
<p>“He has run a course of despicable, commonplace profligacy.
Accept that as the first reason why I spurn him.”</p>

<p>“Miss Keeldar, you shock me!”</p>

<p>“That conduct alone sinks him in a gulf of immeasurable
inferiority. His intellect reaches no standard I can
esteem: there is a second stumbling-block. His views are
narrow, his feelings are blunt, his tastes are coarse, his
manners vulgar.”</p>

<p>“The man is a respectable, wealthy man! To refuse him
is presumption on your part.”</p>

<p>“I refuse point-blank! Cease to annoy me with the
subject; I forbid it!”</p>

<p>“Is it your intention ever to marry; or do you prefer
celibacy?”</p>

<p>“I deny your right to claim an answer to that question.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if you expect some man of title—some peer
of the realm—to demand your hand?”</p>

<p>“I doubt if the peer breathes on whom I would confer it.”</p>

<p>“Were there insanity in the family, I should believe you
mad. Your eccentricity and conceit touch the verge of
frenzy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, ere I have finished, you will see me over-leap
it.”</p>

<p>“I anticipate no less. Frantic and impracticable girl!
Take warning! I dare you to sully our name by a <em>mésalliance</em>!”</p>

<p>“<em>Our</em> name! Am <em>I</em> called Sympson?”</p>

<p>“God be thanked that you are not! But be on your
guard; I will not be trifled with!”</p>

<p>“What, in the name of common law and common sense,
would you or could you do if my pleasure led me to a choice
you disapproved?”</p>

<p>“Take care! take care!” warning her with voice and
hand that trembled alike.</p>

<p>“Why? What shadow of power have <em>you</em> over me?
Why should I fear you?”</p>

<p>“Take care, madam!”</p>

<p>“Scrupulous care I will take, Mr. Sympson. Before I
marry I am resolved to esteem—to admire—to <em>love</em>.”</p>

<p>“Preposterous stuff! indecorous, unwomanly!”</p>

<p>“To love with my whole heart. I know I speak in an
unknown tongue; but I feel indifferent whether I am comprehended
or not.”</p>

<p>“And if this love of yours should fall on a beggar?”</p>

<p>“On a beggar it will never fall. Mendicancy is not
estimable.”</p>

<p>“On a low clerk, a play-actor, a play-writer, or—or⸺”</p>

<p>“Take courage, Mr. Sympson! Or what?”</p>

<p>“Any literary scrub, or shabby, whining artist.”</p>

<p>“For the scrubby, shabby, whining I have no taste; for
literature and the arts I have. And there I wonder how
your Fawthrop Wynne would suit me. He cannot write a
note without orthographical errors; he reads only a sporting
paper; he was the booby of Stilbro’ grammar school!”</p>

<p>“Unladylike language! Great God! to what will she
come?” He lifted hands and eyes.</p>

<p>“Never to the altar of Hymen with Sam Wynne.”</p>

<p>“To what will she come? Why are not the laws more
stringent, that I might compel her to hear reason?”</p>

<p>“Console yourself, uncle. Were Britain a serfdom and
you the Czar, you could not <em>compel</em> me to this step. <em>I</em>
will write to Mr. Wynne. Give yourself no further trouble
on the subject.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>Fortune is proverbially called changeful, yet her caprice
often takes the form of repeating again and again a similar
stroke of luck in the same quarter. It appeared that Miss
Keeldar—or her fortune—had by this time made a sensation
in the district, and produced an impression in quarters
by her unthought of. No less than three offers followed
Mr. Wynne’s, all more or less eligible. All were in succession
pressed on her by her uncle, and all in succession she
refused. Yet amongst them was more than one gentleman
of unexceptionable character as well as ample wealth.
Many besides her uncle asked what she meant, and whom
she expected to entrap, that she was so insolently fastidious.</p>

<p>At last the gossips thought they had found the key to
her conduct, and her uncle was sure of it; and what is
more, the discovery showed his niece to him in quite a new
light, and he changed his whole deportment to her accordingly.</p>

<p>Fieldhead had of late been fast growing too hot to hold
them both. The suave aunt could not reconcile them; the
daughters froze at the view of their quarrels. Gertrude
and Isabella whispered by the hour together in their dressing-room,
and became chilled with decorous dread if they
chanced to be left alone with their audacious cousin. But,
as I have said, a change supervened. Mr. Sympson was
appeased and his family tranquillized.</p>

<p>The village of Nunnely has been alluded to—its old church,
its forest, its monastic ruins. It had also its hall, called the
priory—an older, a larger, a more lordly abode than any
Briarfield or Whinbury owned; and what is more, it had
its man of title—its baronet, which neither Briarfield nor
Whinbury could boast. This possession—its proudest and
most prized—had for years been nominal only. The present
baronet, a young man hitherto resident in a distant province,
was unknown on his Yorkshire estate.</p>

<p>During Miss Keeldar’s stay at the fashionable watering-place
of Cliffbridge, she and her friends had met with and
been introduced to Sir Philip Nunnely. They encountered
him again and again on the sands, the cliffs, in the various
walks, sometimes at the public balls of the place. He
seemed solitary. His manner was very unpretending—too
simple to be termed affable; rather timid than proud. He
did not <em>condescend</em> to their society; he seemed <em>glad</em> of it.</p>

<p>With any unaffected individual Shirley could easily and
quickly cement an acquaintance. She walked and talked
with Sir Philip; she, her aunt, and cousins sometimes took
a sail in his yacht. She liked him because she found him
kind and modest, and was charmed to feel she had the power
to amuse him.</p>

<p>One slight drawback there was—where is the friendship
without it?—Sir Philip had a literary turn. He wrote
poetry—sonnets, stanzas, ballads. Perhaps Miss Keeldar
thought him a little too fond of reading and reciting these
compositions; perhaps she wished the rhyme had possessed
more accuracy, the measure more music, the tropes
more freshness, the inspiration more fire. At any rate, she
always winced when he recurred to the subject of his poems,
and usually did her best to divert the conversation into
another channel.</p>

<p>He would beguile her to take moonlight walks with him
on the bridge, for the sole purpose, as it seemed, of pouring
into her ear the longest of his ballads. He would lead
her away to sequestered rustic seats, whence the rush of
the surf to the sands was heard soft and soothing; and
when he had her all to himself, and the sea lay before them,
and the scented shade of gardens spread round, and the
tall shelter of cliffs rose behind them, he would pull out his
last batch of sonnets, and read them in a voice tremulous
with emotion. He did not seem to know that though they
might be rhyme they were not poetry. It appeared, by
Shirley’s downcast eye and disturbed face, that she knew
it, and felt heartily mortified by the single foible of this
good and amiable gentleman.</p>

<p>Often she tried, as gently as might be, to wean him from
this fanatic worship of the Muses. It was his monomania;
on all ordinary subjects he was sensible enough, and fain
was she to engage him in ordinary topics. He questioned
her sometimes about his place at Nunnely; she was but
too happy to answer his interrogatories at length. She
never wearied of describing the antique priory, the wild
silvan park, the hoary church and hamlet; nor did she fail
to counsel him to come down and gather his tenantry about
him in his ancestral halls.</p>

<p>Somewhat to her surprise, Sir Philip followed her advice
to the letter, and actually, towards the close of September,
arrived at the priory.</p>

<p>He soon made a call at Fieldhead, and his first visit was
not his last. He said—when he had achieved the round
of the neighbourhood—that under no roof had he found
such pleasant shelter as beneath the massive oak beams
of the gray manor-house of Briarfield; a cramped, modest
dwelling enough compared with his own, but he liked it.</p>

<p>Presently it did not suffice to sit with Shirley in her
panelled parlour, where others came and went, and where
he could rarely find a quiet moment to show her the latest
production of his fertile muse; he must have her out amongst
the pleasant pastures, and lead her by the still waters.
<em>Tête-à-tête</em> ramblings she shunned, so he made parties for
her to his own grounds, his glorious forest; to remoter
scenes—woods severed by the Wharfe, vales watered by the
Aire.</p>

<p>Such assiduity covered Miss Keeldar with distinction.
Her uncle’s prophetic soul anticipated a splendid future.
He already scented the time afar off when, with nonchalant
air, and left foot nursed on his right knee, he
should be able to make dashingly-familiar allusion to his
“nephew the baronet.” Now his niece dawned upon him
no longer “a mad girl,” but a “most sensible woman.”
He termed her, in confidential dialogues with Mrs. Sympson,
“a truly superior person; peculiar, but very clever.”
He treated her with exceeding deference; rose reverently
to open and shut doors for her; reddened his face and gave
himself headaches with stooping to pick up gloves, handkerchiefs,
and other loose property, whereof Shirley usually
held but insecure tenure. He would cut mysterious jokes
about the superiority of woman’s wit over man’s wisdom;
commence obscure apologies for the blundering mistake
he had committed respecting the generalship, the tactics,
of “a personage not a hundred miles from Fieldhead.”
In short, he seemed elate as any “midden-cock on pattens.”</p>

<p>His niece viewed his manœuvres and received his innuendoes
with phlegm; apparently she did not above half
comprehend to what aim they tended. When plainly
charged with being the preferred of the baronet, she said
she believed he did like her, and for her part she liked him.
She had never thought a man of rank—the only son of a
proud, fond mother, the only brother of doting sisters—could
have so much goodness, and, on the whole, so much
sense.</p>

<p>Time proved, indeed, that Sir Philip liked her. Perhaps
he had found in her that “curious charm” noticed by Mr.
Hall. He sought her presence more and more, and at last
with a frequency that attested it had become to him an
indispensable stimulus. About this time strange feelings
hovered round Fieldhead; restless hopes and haggard
anxieties haunted some of its rooms. There was an unquiet
wandering of some of the inmates among the still
fields round the mansion; there was a sense of expectancy
that kept the nerves strained.</p>

<p>One thing seemed clear: Sir Philip was not a man to be
despised. He was amiable; if not highly intellectual, he
was intelligent. Miss Keeldar could not affirm of him,
what she had so bitterly affirmed of Sam Wynne, that his
feelings were blunt, his tastes coarse, and his manners
vulgar. There was sensibility in his nature; there was a
very real, if not a very discriminating, love of the arts;
there was the English gentleman in all his deportment.
As to his lineage and wealth, both were, of course, far beyond
her claims.</p>

<p>His appearance had at first elicited some laughing though
not ill-natured remarks from the merry Shirley. It was
boyish. His features were plain and slight, his hair sandy,
his stature insignificant. But she soon checked her sarcasm
on this point; she would even fire up if any one else made
uncomplimentary allusion thereto. He had “a pleasing
countenance,” she affirmed; “and there was that in his
heart which was better than three Roman noses, than the
locks of Absalom or the proportions of Saul.” A spare and
rare shaft she still reserved for his unfortunate poetic propensity;
but even here she would tolerate no irony save
her own.</p>

<p>In short, matters had reached a point which seemed
fully to warrant an observation made about this time by
Mr. Yorke to the tutor, Louis.</p>

<p>“Yond’ brother Robert of yours seems to me to be
either a fool or a madman. Two months ago I could have
sworn he had the game all in his own hands; and there
he runs the country, and quarters himself up in London
for weeks together, and by the time he comes back he’ll
find himself checkmated. Louis, ‘there is a tide in the
affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,
but, once let slip, never returns again.’ I’d write to Robert,
if I were you, and remind him of that.”</p>

<p>“Robert had views on Miss Keeldar?” inquired Louis,
as if the idea was new to him.</p>

<p>“Views I suggested to him myself, and views he might
have realized, for she liked him.”</p>

<p>“As a neighbour?”</p>

<p>“As more than that. I have seen her change countenance
and colour at the mere mention of his name. Write
to the lad, I say, and tell him to come home. He is a finer
gentleman than this bit of a baronet, after all.”</p>

<p>“Does it not strike you, Mr. Yorke, that for a mere
penniless adventurer to aspire to a rich woman’s hand is
presumptuous—contemptible?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you are for high notions and double-refined
sentiment, I’ve naught to say. I’m a plain, practical man
myself, and if Robert is willing to give up that royal prize
to a lad-rival—a puling slip of aristocracy—I am quite
agreeable. At <em>his</em> age, in <em>his</em> place, with <em>his</em> inducements,
I would have acted differently. Neither baronet, nor duke,
nor prince should have snatched my sweetheart from me
without a struggle. But you tutors are such solemn chaps;
it is almost like speaking to a parson to consult with you.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>Flattered and fawned upon as Shirley was just now, it
appeared she was not absolutely spoiled—that her better
nature did not quite leave her. Universal report had indeed
ceased to couple her name with that of Moore, and this
silence seemed sanctioned by her own apparent oblivion
of the absentee; but that she had not <em>quite</em> forgotten him—that
she still regarded him, if not with love, yet with
interest—seemed proved by the increased attention which
at this juncture of affairs a sudden attack of illness induced
her to show that tutor-brother of Robert’s, to whom she
habitually bore herself with strange alternations of cool
reserve and docile respect—now sweeping past him in all
the dignity of the moneyed heiress and prospective Lady
Nunnely, and anon accosting him as abashed school-girls
are wont to accost their stern professors; bridling her neck
of ivory and curling her lip of carmine, if he encountered
her glance, one minute, and the next submitting to the
grave rebuke of his eye with as much contrition as if he had
the power to inflict penalties in case of contumacy.</p>

<p>Louis Moore had perhaps caught the fever, which for
a few days laid him low, in one of the poor cottages of
the district, which he, his lame pupil, and Mr. Hall were
in the habit of visiting together. At any rate he sickened,
and after opposing to the malady a taciturn resistance for
a day or two, was obliged to keep his chamber.</p>

<p>He lay tossing on his thorny bed one evening, Henry,
who would not quit him, watching faithfully beside him,
when a tap—too light to be that of Mrs. Gill or the housemaid—summoned
young Sympson to the door.</p>

<p>“How is Mr. Moore to-night?” asked a low voice from
the dark gallery.</p>

<p>“Come in and see him yourself.”</p>

<p>“Is he asleep?”</p>

<p>“I wish he could sleep. Come and speak to him, Shirley.”</p>

<p>“He would not like it.”</p>

<p>But the speaker stepped in, and Henry, seeing her hesitate
on the threshold, took her hand and drew her to the couch.</p>

<p>The shaded light showed Miss Keeldar’s form but imperfectly;
yet it revealed her in elegant attire. There was
a party assembled below, including Sir Philip Nunnely;
the ladies were now in the drawing-room, and their hostess
had stolen from them to visit Henry’s tutor. Her pure
white dress, her fair arms and neck, the trembling chainlet
of gold circling her throat and quivering on her breast,
glistened strangely amid the obscurity of the sickroom.
Her mien was chastened and pensive. She spoke gently.</p>

<p>“Mr. Moore, how are you to-night?”</p>

<p>“I have not been very ill, and am now better.”</p>

<p>“I heard that you complained of thirst. I have brought
you some grapes; can you taste one?”</p>

<p>“No; but I thank you for remembering me.”</p>

<p>“Just one.”</p>

<p>From the rich cluster that filled a small basket held in
her hand she severed a berry and offered it to his lips.
He shook his head, and turned aside his flushed face.</p>

<p>“But what, then, can I bring you instead? You have
no wish for fruit; yet I see that your lips are parched.
What beverage do you prefer?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gill supplies me with toast-and-water. I like it
best.”</p>

<p>Silence fell for some minutes.</p>

<p>“Do you suffer?—have you pain?”</p>

<p>“Very little.”</p>

<p>“What made you ill?”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“I wonder what caused this fever? To what do you
attribute it?”</p>

<p>“Miasma, perhaps—malaria. This is autumn, a season
fertile in fevers.”</p>

<p>“I hear you often visit the sick in Briarfield, and Nunnely
too, with Mr. Hall. You should be on your guard; temerity
is not wise.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Miss Keeldar, that perhaps you had
better not enter this chamber or come near this couch.
I do not believe my illness is infectious. I scarcely fear”—with
a sort of smile—”<em>you</em> will take it; but why should
you run even the shadow of a risk? Leave me.”</p>

<p>“Patience, I will go soon; but I should like to do something
for you before I depart—any little service⸺”</p>

<p>“They will miss you below.”</p>

<p>“No; the gentlemen are still at table.”</p>

<p>“They will not linger long. Sir Philip Nunnely is no
wine-bibber, and I hear him just now pass from the dining-room
to the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“It is a servant.”</p>

<p>“It is Sir Philip; I know his step.”</p>

<p>“Your hearing is acute.”</p>

<p>“It is never dull, and the sense seems sharpened at
present. Sir Philip was here to tea last night. I heard
you sing to him some song which he had brought you.
I heard him, when he took his departure at eleven o’clock,
call you out on to the pavement, to look at the evening
star.”</p>

<p>“You must be nervously sensitive.”</p>

<p>“I heard him kiss your hand.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“No: my chamber is over the hall, the window just
above the front door; the sash was a little raised, for I
felt feverish. You stood ten minutes with him on the steps.
I heard your discourse, every word, and I heard the salute.—Henry,
give me some water.”</p>

<p>“Let me give it him.”</p>

<p>But he half rose to take the glass from young Sympson,
and declined her attendance.</p>

<p>“And can I do nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; for you cannot guarantee me a night’s
peaceful rest, and it is all I at present want.”</p>

<p>“You do not sleep well?”</p>

<p>“Sleep has left me.”</p>

<p>“Yet you said you were not very ill?”</p>

<p>“I am often sleepless when in high health.”</p>

<p>“If I had power, I would lap you in the most placid
slumber—quite deep and hushed, without a dream.”</p>

<p>“Blank annihilation! I do not ask that.”</p>

<p>“With dreams of all you most desire.”</p>

<p>“Monstrous delusions! The sleep would be delirium,
the waking death.”</p>

<p>“Your wishes are not so chimerical; you are no visionary.”</p>

<p>“Miss Keeldar, I suppose you think so; but my character
is not, perhaps, quite as legible to you as a page of the last
new novel might be.”</p>

<p>“That is possible. But this sleep—I <em>should</em> like to woo
it to your pillow, to win for you its favour. If I took a
book and sat down and read some pages? I can well spare
half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I will not detain you.”</p>

<p>“I would read softly.”</p>

<p>“It would not do. I am too feverish and excitable
to bear a soft, cooing, vibrating voice close at my ear.
You had better leave me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will go.”</p>

<p>“And no good-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, yes. Mr. Moore, good-night.” (Exit Shirley.)</p>

<p>“Henry, my boy, go to bed now; it is time you had
some repose.”</p>

<p>“Sir, it would please me to watch at your bedside all
night.”</p>

<p>“Nothing less called for. I am getting better. There,
go.”</p>

<p>“Give me your blessing, sir.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, my best pupil!”</p>

<p>“You never call me your dearest pupil!”</p>

<p>“No, nor ever shall.”</p>

<hr class=""/>

<p>Possibly Miss Keeldar resented her former teacher’s
rejection of her courtesy. It is certain she did not repeat
the offer of it. Often as her light step traversed the gallery
in the course of a day, it did not again pause at his door;
nor did her “cooing, vibrating voice” disturb a second
time the hush of the sickroom. A sickroom, indeed, it
soon ceased to be; Mr. Moore’s good constitution quickly
triumphed over his indisposition. In a few days he shook
it off, and resumed his duties as tutor.</p>

<p>That “auld lang syne” had still its authority both with
preceptor and scholar was proved by the manner in which
he sometimes promptly passed the distance she usually
maintained between them, and put down her high reserve
with a firm, quiet hand.</p>

<p>One afternoon the Sympson family were gone out to
take a carriage airing. Shirley, never sorry to snatch a
reprieve from their society, had remained behind, detained
by business, as she said. The business—a little letter-writing—was
soon dispatched after the yard gates had
closed on the carriage; Miss Keeldar betook herself to the
garden.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful autumn day. The gilding of the
Indian summer mellowed the pastures far and wide. The
russet woods stood ripe to be stripped, but were yet full
of leaf. The purple of heath-bloom, faded but not
withered, tinged the hills. The beck wandered down to
the Hollow, through a silent district; no wind followed
its course or haunted its woody borders. Fieldhead gardens
bore the seal of gentle decay. On the walks, swept that
morning, yellow leaves had fluttered down again. Its time
of flowers, and even of fruits, was over; but a scantling
of apples enriched the trees. Only a blossom here and there
expanded pale and delicate amidst a knot of faded leaves.</p>

<p>These single flowers—the last of their race—Shirley
culled as she wandered thoughtfully amongst the beds.
She was fastening into her girdle a hueless and scentless
nosegay, when Henry Sympson called to her as he came
limping from the house.</p>

<p>“Shirley, Mr. Moore would be glad to see you in the
schoolroom and to hear you read a little French, if you
have no more urgent occupation.”</p>

<p>The messenger delivered his commission very simply, as
if it were a mere matter of course.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Moore tell you to say that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; why not? And now, do come, and let
us once more be as we were at Sympson Grove. We used
to have pleasant school-hours in those days.”</p>

<p>Miss Keeldar perhaps thought that circumstances were
changed since then; however, she made no remark, but
after a little reflection quietly followed Henry.</p>

<p>Entering the schoolroom, she inclined her head with
a decent obeisance, as had been her wont in former times.
She removed her bonnet, and hung it up beside Henry’s
cap. Louis Moore sat at his desk, turning the leaves of
a book, open before him, and marking passages with his
pencil. He just moved, in acknowledgment of her curtsy,
but did not rise.</p>

<p>“You proposed to read to me a few nights ago,” said he.
“I could not hear you then. My attention is now at your
service. A little renewed practice in French may not be unprofitable.
Your accent, I have observed, begins to rust.”</p>

<p>“What book shall I take?”</p>

<p>“Here are the posthumous works of St. Pierre. Read
a few pages of the ‘Fragments de l’Amazone.’”</p>

<p>She accepted the chair which he had placed in readiness
near his own; the volume lay on his desk—there was but
one between them; her sweeping curls dropped so low as
to hide the page from him.</p>

<p>“Put back your hair,” he said.</p>

<p>For one moment Shirley looked not quite certain whether
she would obey the request or disregard it. A flicker of
her eye beamed furtive on the professor’s face. Perhaps if
he had been looking at her harshly or timidly, or if one
undecided line had marked his countenance, she would have
rebelled, and the lesson had ended there and then; but he
was only awaiting her compliance—as calm as marble, and
as cool. She threw the veil of tresses behind her ear. It
was well her face owned an agreeable outline, and that her
cheek possessed the polish and the roundness of early youth,
or, thus robbed of a softening shade, the contours might
have lost their grace. But what mattered that in the
present society? Neither Calypso nor Eucharis cared to
fascinate Mentor.</p>

<p>She began to read. The language had become strange
to her tongue; it faltered; the lecture flowed unevenly,
impeded by hurried breath, broken by Anglicized tones.
She stopped.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it. Read me a paragraph, if you please,
Mr. Moore.”</p>

<p>What <em>he</em> read <em>she</em> repeated. She caught his accent in
three minutes.</p>

<p>“Très bien,” was the approving comment at the close
of the piece.</p>

<p>“C’est presque le Français rattrapé, n’est-ce pas?”</p>

<p>“You could not write French as you once could, I dare
say?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! I should make strange work of my concords
now.”</p>

<p>“You could not compose the <em>devoir</em> of ‘La Première
Femme Savante’?”</p>

<p>“Do you still remember that rubbish?”</p>

<p>“Every line.”</p>

<p>“I doubt you.”</p>

<p>“I will engage to repeat it word for word.”</p>

<p>“You would stop short at the first line.”</p>

<p>“Challenge me to the experiment.”</p>

<p>“I challenge you.”</p>

<p>He proceeded to recite the following. He gave it in
French, but we must translate, on pain of being unintelligible
to some readers.</p>

<hr class="" />

<p class="">“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons
of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they
took them wives of all which they chose.”</p>

<p>This was in the dawn of time, before the morning stars
were set, and while they yet sang together.</p>

<p>The epoch is so remote, the mists and dewy gray of
matin twilight veil it with so vague an obscurity, that all
distinct feature of custom, all clear line of locality, evade
perception and baffle research. It must suffice to know
that the world then existed; that men peopled it; that
man’s nature, with its passions, sympathies, pains, and
pleasures, informed the planet and gave it soul.</p>

<p>A certain tribe colonized a certain spot on the globe;
of what race this tribe—unknown; in what region that
spot—untold. We usually think of the East when we
refer to transactions of that date; but who shall declare
that there was no life in the West, the South, the North?
What is to disprove that this tribe, instead of camping
under palm groves in Asia, wandered beneath island oak
woods rooted in our own seas of Europe?</p>

<p>It is no sandy plain, nor any circumscribed and scant
oasis I seem to realize. A forest valley, with rocky sides
and brown profundity of shade, formed by tree crowding
on tree, descends deep before me. Here, indeed, dwell
human beings, but so few, and in alleys so thick branched
and overarched, they are neither heard nor seen. Are they
savage? Doubtless. They live by the crook and the bow;
half shepherds, half hunters, their flocks wander wild as
their prey. Are they happy? No, not more happy than
we are at this day. Are they good? No, not better than
ourselves. Their nature is our nature—human both. There
is one in this tribe too often miserable—a child bereaved
of both parents. None cares for this child. She is fed
sometimes, but oftener forgotten. A hut rarely receives
her; the hollow tree and chill cavern are her home. Forsaken,
lost, and wandering, she lives more with the wild
beast and bird than with her own kind. Hunger and cold
are her comrades; sadness hovers over, and solitude besets
her round. Unheeded and unvalued, she should die; but
she both lives and grows. The green wilderness nurses her,
and becomes to her a mother; feeds her on juicy berry, on
saccharine root and nut.</p>

<p>There is something in the air of this clime which fosters
life kindly. There must be something, too, in its dews
which heals with sovereign balm. Its gentle seasons
exaggerate no passion, no sense; its temperature tends
to harmony; its breezes, you would say, bring down from
heaven the germ of pure thought and purer feeling. Not
grotesquely fantastic are the forms of cliff and foliage, not
violently vivid the colouring of flower and bird. In all the
grandeur of these forests there is repose; in all their freshness
there is tenderness.</p>

<p>The gentle charm vouchsafed to flower and tree, bestowed
on deer and dove, has not been denied to the human nursling.
All solitary, she has sprung up straight and graceful.
Nature cast her features in a fine mould; they have matured
in their pure, accurate first lines, unaltered by the shocks
of disease. No fierce dry blast has dealt rudely with the
surface of her frame; no burning sun has crisped or withered
her tresses. Her form gleams ivory-white through the
trees; her hair flows plenteous, long, and glossy; her eyes,
not dazzled by vertical fires, beam in the shade large and
open, and full and dewy. Above those eyes, when the
breeze bares her forehead, shines an expanse fair and ample—a
clear, candid page, whereon knowledge, should knowledge
ever come, might write a golden record. You see in
the desolate young savage nothing vicious or vacant. She
haunts the wood harmless and thoughtful, though of what
one so untaught can think it is not easy to divine.</p>

<p>On the evening of one summer day, before the Flood,
being utterly alone—for she had lost all trace of her tribe,
who had wandered leagues away, she knew not where—she
went up from the vale, to watch Day take leave and
Night arrive. A crag overspread by a tree was her station.
The oak roots, turfed and mossed, gave a seat; the oak
boughs, thick-leaved, wove a canopy.</p>

<p>Slow and grand the Day withdrew, passing in purple
fire, and parting to the farewell of a wild, low chorus from
the woodlands. Then Night entered, quiet as death.
The wind fell, the birds ceased singing. Now every nest
held happy mates, and hart and hind slumbered blissfully
safe in their lair.</p>

<p>The girl sat, her body still, her soul astir; occupied,
however, rather in feeling than in thinking, in wishing
than hoping, in imagining than projecting. She felt the
world, the sky, the night, boundlessly mighty. Of all
things herself seemed to herself the centre—a small, forgotten
atom of life, a spark of soul, emitted inadvertent
from the great creative source, and now burning unmarked
to waste in the heart of a black hollow. She asked, was
she thus to burn out and perish, her living light doing no good,
never seen, never needed—a star in an else starless firmament,
which nor shepherd, nor wanderer, nor sage, nor
priest tracked as a guide or read as a prophecy? Could this
be, she demanded, when the flame of her intelligence burned
so vivid; when her life beat so true, and real, and potent;
when something within her stirred disquieted, and restlessly
asserted a God-given strength, for which it insisted she
should find exercise?</p>

<p>She gazed abroad on Heaven and Evening. Heaven
and Evening gazed back on her. She bent down, searching
bank, hill, river, spread dim below. All she questioned
responded by oracles. She heard—she was impressed;
but she could not understand. Above her head she raised
her hands joined together.</p>

<p>“Guidance—help—comfort—come!” was her cry.</p>

<p>There was no voice, nor any that answered.</p>

<p>She waited, kneeling, steadfastly looking up. Yonder
sky was sealed; the solemn stars shone alien and remote.</p>

<p>At last one overstretched chord of her agony slacked;
she thought Something above relented; she felt as if Something
far round drew nigher; she heard as if Silence spoke.
There was no language, no word, only a tone.</p>

<p>Again—a fine, full, lofty tone, a deep, soft sound, like
a storm whispering, made twilight undulate.</p>

<p>Once more, profounder, nearer, clearer, it rolled harmonious.</p>

<p>Yet again—a distinct voice passed between Heaven
and Earth.</p>

<p>“Eva!”</p>

<p>If Eva were not this woman’s name, she had none. She
rose. “Here am I.”</p>

<p>“Eva!”</p>

<p>“O Night (it can be but Night that speaks), I am here!”</p>

<p>The voice, descending, reached Earth.</p>

<p>“Eva!”</p>

<p>“Lord,” she cried, “behold thine handmaid!”</p>

<p>She had her religion—all tribes held some creed.</p>

<p>“I come—a Comforter!”</p>

<p>“Lord, come quickly!”</p>

<p>The Evening flushed full of hope; the Air panted;
the Moon—rising before—ascended large, but her light
showed no shape.</p>

<p>“Lean towards me, Eva. Enter my arms; repose
thus.”</p>

<p>“Thus I lean, O Invisible but felt! And what art thou?”</p>

<p>“Eva, I have brought a living draught from heaven.
Daughter of Man, drink of my cup!”</p>

<p>“I drink: it is as if sweetest dew visited my lips in
a full current. My arid heart revives; my affliction is
lightened; my strait and struggle are gone. And the
night changes! the wood, the hill, the moon, the wide
sky—all change!”</p>

<p>“All change, and for ever. I take from thy vision
darkness; I loosen from thy faculties fetters! I level
in thy path obstacles; I with my presence fill vacancy.
I claim as mine the lost atom of life. I take to myself
the spark of soul—burning heretofore forgotten!”</p>

<p>“O take me! O claim me! This is a god.”</p>

<p>“This is a son of God—one who feels himself in the
portion of life that stirs you. He is suffered to reclaim his
own, and so to foster and aid that it shall not perish hopeless.”</p>

<p>“A son of God! Am I indeed chosen?”</p>

<p>“Thou only in this land. I saw thee that thou wert
fair; I knew thee that thou wert mine. To me it is given
to rescue, to sustain, to cherish mine own. Acknowledge
in me that Seraph on earth named Genius.”</p>

<p>“My glorious Bridegroom! true Dayspring from on high!
All I would have at last I possess. I receive a revelation.
The dark hint, the obscure whisper, which have haunted me
from childhood, are interpreted. Thou art He I sought.
Godborn, take me, thy bride!”</p>

<p>“Unhumbled, I can take what is mine. Did I not
give from the altar the very flame which lit Eva’s being?
Come again into the heaven whence thou wert
sent.”</p>

<p>That Presence, invisible but mighty, gathered her in
like a lamb to the fold; that voice, soft but all-pervading,
vibrated through her heart like music. Her eye received
no image; and yet a sense visited her vision and her brain
as of the serenity of stainless air, the power of sovereign
seas, the majesty of marching stars, the energy of colliding
elements, the rooted endurance of hills wide based, and,
above all, as of the lustre of heroic beauty rushing victorious
on the Night, vanquishing its shadows like a diviner
sun.</p>

<p>Such was the bridal hour of Genius and Humanity. Who
shall rehearse the tale of their after-union? Who shall
depict its bliss and bale? Who shall tell how He between
whom and the Woman God put enmity forged deadly plots
to break the bond or defile its purity? Who shall record
the long strife between Serpent and Seraph:—How still the
Father of Lies insinuated evil into good, pride into wisdom,
grossness into glory, pain into bliss, poison into passion?
How the “dreadless Angel” defied, resisted, and repelled?
How again and again he refined the polluted cup, exalted
the debased emotion, rectified the perverted impulse, detected
the lurking venom, baffled the frontless temptation—purified,
justified, watched, and withstood? How, by his
patience, by his strength, by that unutterable excellence
he held from God—his Origin—this faithful Seraph fought
for Humanity a good fight through time; and, when Time’s
course closed, and Death was encountered at the end,
barring with fleshless arm the portals of Eternity, how
Genius still held close his dying bride, sustained her through
the agony of the passage, bore her triumphant into his
own home, Heaven; restored her, redeemed, to Jehovah,
her Maker; and at last, before Angel and Archangel, crowned
her with the crown of Immortality?</p>

<p>Who shall of these things write the chronicle?</p>

<hr/>

<p>“I never could correct that composition,” observed
Shirley, as Moore concluded. “Your censor-pencil scored
it with condemnatory lines, whose signification I strove
vainly to fathom.”</p>

<p>She had taken a crayon from the tutor’s desk, and was
drawing little leaves, fragments of pillars, broken crosses,
on the margin of the book.</p>

<p>“French may be half forgotten, but the habits of the
French lesson are retained, I see,” said Louis. “My
books would now, as erst, be unsafe with you. My newly-bound
St. Pierre would soon be like my Racine—Miss
Keeldar, her mark, traced on every page.”</p>

<p>Shirley dropped her crayon as if it burned her fingers.</p>

<p>“Tell me what were the faults of that <em>devoir</em>?” she asked.
“Were they grammatical errors, or did you object to the
substance?”</p>

<p>“I never said that the lines I drew were indications
of faults at all. You would have it that such was the case,
and I refrained from contradiction.”</p>

<p>“What else did they denote?”</p>

<p>“No matter now.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Moore,” cried Henry, “make Shirley repeat some
of the pieces she used to say so well by heart.”</p>

<p>“If I ask for any, it will be ‘Le Cheval Dompté,’”
said Moore, trimming with his penknife the pencil Miss
Keeldar had worn to a stump.</p>

<p>She turned aside her head; the neck, the clear cheek,
forsaken by their natural veil, were seen to flush warm.</p>

<p>“Ah! she has not forgotten, you see, sir,” said Henry,
exultant. “She knows how naughty she was.”</p>

<p>A smile, which Shirley would not permit to expand,
made her lip tremble; she bent her face, and hid it half
with her arms, half in her curls, which, as she stooped,
fell loose again. “Certainly I was a rebel,” she answered.</p>

<p>“A rebel!” repeated Henry. “Yes; you and papa
had quarrelled terribly, and you set both him and mamma,
and Mrs. Pryor, and everybody, at defiance. You said he
had insulted you⸺”</p>

<p>“He <em>had</em> insulted me,” interposed Shirley.</p>

<p>“And you wanted to leave Sympson Grove directly.
You packed your things up, and papa threw them out
of your trunk; mamma cried, Mrs. Pryor cried; they
both stood wringing their hands begging you to be patient;
and you knelt on the floor with your things and your up-turned
box before you, looking, Shirley, looking—why, in
one of <em>your</em> passions. Your features, in such passions, are
not distorted; they are fixed, but quite beautiful. You
scarcely look angry, only resolute, and in a certain haste;
yet one feels that at such times an obstacle cast across your
path would be split as with lightning. Papa lost heart, and
called Mr. Moore.”</p>

<p>“Enough, Henry.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not enough. I hardly know how Mr. Moore
managed, except that I recollect he suggested to papa that
agitation would bring on his gout; and then he spoke
quietly to the ladies, and got them away; and afterwards
he said to you, Miss Shirley, that it was of no use talking or
lecturing now, but that the tea-things were just brought into
the schoolroom, and he was very thirsty, and he would be
glad if you would leave your packing for the present and
come and make a cup of tea for him and me. You came;
you would not talk at first, but soon you softened and grew
cheerful. Mr. Moore began to tell us about the Continent,
the war, and Bonaparte—subjects we were both fond of
listening to. After tea he said we should neither of us leave
him that evening; he would not let us stray out of his sight,
lest we should again get into mischief. We sat one on each
side of him. We were so happy. I never passed so pleasant
an evening. The next day he gave you, missy, a lecture of
an hour, and wound it up by marking you a piece to learn
in Bossuet as a punishment-lesson—’Le Cheval Dompté.’
You learned it instead of packing up, Shirley. We heard
no more of your running away. Mr. Moore used to tease you
on the subject for a year afterwards.”</p>

<p>“She never said a lesson with greater spirit,” subjoined
Moore. “She then, for the first time, gave me the treat
of hearing my native tongue spoken without accent by an
English girl.”</p>

<p>“She was as sweet as summer cherries for a month
afterwards,” struck in Henry: “a good hearty quarrel
always left Shirley’s temper better than it found
it.”</p>

<p>“You talk of me as if I were not present,” observed
Miss Keeldar, who had not yet lifted her face.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you <em>are</em> present?” asked Moore. “There
have been moments since my arrival here when I have been
tempted to inquire of the lady of Fieldhead if she knew
what had become of my former pupil.”</p>

<p>“She is here now.”</p>

<p>“I see her, and humble enough; but I would neither
advise Harry nor others to believe too implicitly in the
humility which one moment can hide its blushing face like
a modest little child, and the next lift it pale and lofty as a
marble Juno.”</p>

<p>“One man in times of old, it is said, imparted vitality
to the statue he had chiselled; others may have the contrary
gift of turning life to stone.”</p>

<p>Moore paused on this observation before he replied to
it. His look, at once struck and meditative, said, “A
strange phrase; what may it mean?” He turned it over
in his mind, with thought deep and slow, as some German
pondering metaphysics.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he said at last, “that some men inspire
repugnance, and so chill the kind heart.”</p>

<p>“Ingenious!” responded Shirley. “If the interpretation
pleases you, you are welcome to hold it valid. <em>I</em>
don’t care.”</p>

<p>And with that she raised her head, lofty in look and statue-like
in hue, as Louis had described it.</p>

<p>“Behold the metamorphosis!” he said; “scarce imagined
ere it is realized: a lowly nymph develops to an inaccessible
goddess. But Henry must not be disappointed
of his recitation, and Olympia will deign to oblige him.
Let us begin.”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten the very first line.”</p>

<p>“Which I have not. <em>My</em> memory, if a slow, is a retentive
one. I acquire deliberately both knowledge and liking.
The acquisition grows into my brain, and the sentiment
into my breast; and it is not as the rapid-springing
produce which, having no root in itself, flourishes verdurous
enough for a time, but too soon falls withered away.
Attention, Henry! Miss Keeldar consents to favour
you. ‘Voyez ce cheval ardent et impétueux,’ so it commences.”</p>

<p>Miss Keeldar did consent to make the effort; but she
soon stopped.</p>

<p>“Unless I heard the whole repeated I cannot continue
it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yet it was quickly learned—’soon gained, soon gone,’”
moralized the tutor. He recited the passage deliberately,
accurately, with slow, impressive emphasis.</p>

<p>Shirley, by degrees, inclined her ear as he went on. Her
face, before turned from him, <em>re</em>turned towards him. When
he ceased, she took the word up as if from his lips; she
took his very tone; she seized his very accent; she delivered
the periods as he had delivered them; she reproduced
his manner, his pronunciation, his expression.</p>

<p>It was now her turn to petition.</p>

<p>“Recall ‘Le Songe d’Athalie,’” she entreated, “and
say it.”</p>

<p>He said it for her. She took it from him; she found
lively excitement in the pleasure of making his language
her own. She asked for further indulgence; all the old
school pieces were revived, and with them Shirley’s old
school days.</p>

<p>He had gone through some of the best passages of Racine
and Corneille, and then had heard the echo of his own
deep tones in the girl’s voice, that modulated itself faithfully
on his. “Le chêne et le Roseau,” that most beautiful
of La Fontaine’s fables, had been recited, well recited, by
the tutor, and the pupil had animatedly availed herself
of the lesson. Perhaps a simultaneous feeling seized them
now, that their enthusiasm had kindled to a glow, which
the slight fuel of French poetry no longer sufficed to feed;
perhaps they longed for a trunk of English oak to be thrown
as a Yule log to the devouring flame. Moore observed,
“And these are our best pieces! And we have nothing
more dramatic, nervous, natural!”</p>

<p>And then he smiled and was silent. His whole nature
seemed serenely alight. He stood on the hearth, leaning
his elbow on the mantelpiece, musing not unblissfully.</p>

<p>Twilight was closing on the diminished autumn day.
The schoolroom windows—darkened with creeping plants,
from which no high October winds had as yet swept the
sere foliage—admitted scarce a gleam of sky; but the fire
gave light enough to talk by.</p>

<p>And now Louis Moore addressed his pupil in French,
and she answered at first with laughing hesitation and in
broken phrase. Moore encouraged while he corrected
her. Henry joined in the lesson; the two scholars stood
opposite the master, their arms round each other’s waists.
Tartar, who long since had craved and obtained admission,
sat sagely in the centre of the rug, staring at the blaze which
burst fitful from morsels of coal among the red cinders.
The group were happy enough, but—</p>

“Pleasures are like poppies spread;<br/>
You seize the flower—its bloom is shed.”<br/>

<p>The dull, rumbling sound of wheels was heard on the pavement
in the yard.</p>

<p>“It is the carriage returned,” said Shirley; “and dinner
must be just ready, and I am not dressed.”</p>

<p>A servant came in with Mr. Moore’s candle and tea;
for the tutor and his pupil usually dined at luncheon
time.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sympson and the ladies are returned,” she said,
“and Sir Philip Nunnely is with them.”</p>

<p>“How you did start, and how your hand trembled,
Shirley!” said Henry, when the maid had closed the shutter
and was gone. “But I know why—don’t you, Mr.
Moore? I know what papa intends. He is a little ugly
man, that Sir Philip. I wish he had not come. I wish
sisters and all of them had stayed at De Walden Hall
to dine.—Shirley should once more have made tea for
you and me, Mr. Moore, and we would have had a happy
evening of it.”</p>

<p>Moore was locking up his desk and putting away his
St. Pierre. “That was <em>your</em> plan, was it, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you approve it, sir?”</p>

<p>“I approve nothing utopian. Look Life in its iron
face; stare Reality out of its brassy countenance. Make
the tea, Henry; I shall be back in a minute.”</p>

<p>He left the room; so did Shirley, by another door.</p>
