<!--chapter title: CHAPTER XXIX. The Silver Coffer.-->

<p>Within Sir Giles Mompesson’s vast and gloomy
mansion, it has been said there were certain rooms
which, from their size and splendour, formed a striking
contrast to the rest of the habitation. Never used, —
except on extraordinary occasions, when their owner
gave a grand entertainment with some ulterior object,
—these apartments, notwithstanding their magnificence,
partook in some degree of the chilling and inhospitable
character of the house. Even when brilliantly lighted
up, they wanted warmth and comfort; and though the
banquets given within them were sumptuous and profuse,
and the wine flowed without stint, the guests
went away dissatisfied, and railing against their ostentatious
host. Thus, though the stone walls were hung
with rich tapestry, the dust had gathered thickly upon
its folds, while portions of the rugged masonry were
revealed to view. The furniture was massive, but
cumbrous and ill-assorted; and the gilded ceiling and
Venetian mirrors, from want of care, had become
tarnished and dim.</p>

<p>Such as they were, however, these apartments were
assigned to Aveline, when she was forcibly brought to
the extortioner’s habitation, as before narrated. Allowed
to range within them at pleasure, she was kept strictly
within their limits. The doors were constantly guarded
by one or other of the myrmidons; and any communication
with the external world was impossible, because
the windows were partially grated, and looked into a
court-yard. Beyond this, she was subjected to no restraint;
and her own attendants, Dame Sherborne and
old Anthony Eocke, were suffered to remain with her.</p>

<p>Had it not been for her exposure to the annoyance
of frequent from Sir Francis Mitchell, and her anxiety
about Sir Jocelyn, Aveline would not have found her
confinement so intolerable. But the enamoured old
usurer persecuted her at all hours, and she could never
be free from the intrusion, since the doors could not
be shut against him. Sometimes, he came accompanied
by his partner, though more frequently alone, but ever
with the same purpose, — namely, that of protesting
the violence of his passion, and seeking to soften her
obduracy. As may be well supposed, his pleadings,
however urged, were wholly ineffectual, and excited
no other feelings, except those of detestation, in her
bosom. Such a state of things could not endure for
ever; and her only hope was, that finding all his efforts
to move her fruitless, he would in time desist from
them. Not that she was without other fearful apprehensions,
which were shared by her attendants.</p>

<p>Nearly a fortnight had thus passed by, when, one
day, during which she had seen nothing of her tormentor,
and was rejoicing at the circumstance, the
repast usually served at noon was brought in by a fresh
serving-man. Something in this person’s manner, and
in the meaning glance he fixed upon her attracted her
attention; otherwise, he was a man of singularly unprepossessing
appearance. She addressed a few words
to him, but he made no reply, and became suddenly
as reserved as his predecessor had been. This deportment,
however, it presently appeared, was only assumed.
While placing a flask of wine on the table, the man
said in a low tone — “I am a friend of Sir Jocelyn.
Constrain yourself, or you will betray me. Sir Francis
is watching us from an eyelet-hole in the door. Drink
of this,” he added, pouring wine into a goblet.</p>

<p>“Is it medicated?” she asked in a whisper, regarding
him anxiously.</p>

<p>“It is supposed to be so,” he answered, with a
scarcely perceptible smile. “Drink, I say. If you do
not, you will mar my project. ‘T is well!” he added,
as she raised the goblet to her lips. “A few words
must explain my design. Sir Francis will fancy you
have swallowed a love-potion. Take care not to undeceive
him, for on that belief rests your safety. When
he presents himself, as he will do shortly, do not repulse
him as heretofore. Smile on him as kindly as
you can; and though the task of duping him may be
difficult and distasteful to you, shrink not from it.
The necessity of the case justifies the deception. If
he presses his suit, no longer refuse him your hand.”</p>

<p>“I cannot do it,” murmured Aveline, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“You must,” rejoined Luke Hatton — for it was
he — “or incur worse dangers. Provoked by your
resistance, Sir Francis has lost all patience, and is
determined to accomplish his purpose. Knowing my
skill as a brewer of philters, he has applied to me,
and I have promised him aid. But have no fear.
Though employed by him, I am devoted to you, and
will effect your deliverance — ay, and avenge you
upon your persecutors at the same time — if you
follow my instructions exactly. Eaise the goblet to
your lips again. Quaff its contents without apprehension
—they are perfectly harmless. Force smiles to
your features — give tenderness to your tones, and
softness to your glances — and all will be won.”</p>

<p>And with a grin, which, though intended to encourage
her, somewhat alarmed Aveline, he took up
the flask of wine and departed.</p>

<p>As her singular adviser had predicted, it was not
long before the old usurer made his appearance, evidently
full of eagerness to ascertain whether any change had
been wrought in her disposition towards him by the
wonder-working draught. Dissembling her aversion as
well as she could, and assuming looks very foreign to
her feelings, she easily succeeded in persuading him
that the philter had taken effect, and that all obstacles
to his happiness were removed. Transported with
rapture, he fell upon his knees, and besought her to
crown his felicity by consenting to their union on the
following day. Bewildered by various emotions, yet
still managing to play her part, she returned an answer,
which he construed into an affirmative; and now quite
beside himself with delight, the amorous old dotard
left her.</p>

<p>The alteration in Aveline’s manner and deportment
towards her persecutor, did not escape the notice of
her attendants, and greatly perplexed them. Dame
Sherbourne ventured to remonstrate with her, hoping
she could not be in earnest; and old Anthony Rocke
bluntly told her he would rather see her in her grave
than the bride of such a hoary reprobate as Sir Francis.
Aware that her actions were watched, Aveline thought
it best to’ dissemble, even with her attendants; and
they were both convinced she was either bewitched or
had lost her senses; and in either case bitterly deplored
her fate.</p>

<p>Nor must it be supposed that Aveline herself was
without much secret misgiving, however skilfully and
courageously she might act her part. The appearance
of Luke Hatton, as we have more than once remarked,
was calculated to inspire distrust in all brought in
contact with him; and with no other proofs of his sincerity
except such as were furnished by the circumstances,
she might well entertain suspicion of him.
While professing devotion, he might intend to betray
her. In that event, if driven to extremity, she resolved
to liberate herself by the only means that would then
be left her.</p>

<p>In the evening, Luke Hatton paid her a second
visit; and on this occasion comported himself with as
much caution as at first. He applauded her conduct
towards Sir Francis, whom he stated to be most effectually
duped, and counselled her to persevere in the
same course; adding, with his customary sardonic
grin, that grand preparations were making for the
wedding-feast, but he thought the cook’s labours likely
to be thrown away.</p>

<p>Next day, Aveline found all her counsellor had
told her was correct. Several of the rooms, hitherto
thrown open to her — in especial the great banquetting-chamber
— were now closed; and it was evident from
the sounds that reached her ear — footsteps hurrying
to and fro, loud impatient voices, and noises occasioned
by the removal of furniture, and the placing of chairs
and tables, together with the clatter of plates and dishes
— that preparations for a festival were going on actively
within them. Nothing could equal the consternation
and distress exhibited by Dame Sherborne and
old Anthony Rocke; but, faithful to her scheme,
Aveline (however she desired it) did not relieve their
anxiety.</p>

<p>At noon, Luke Hatton came again. He seemed
in great glee; and informed her that all was going on
as well as could be desired. He counselled her to
make two requests of Sir Francis. First, that he should
endow her with ten thousand marks, to be delivered
to her before the nuptials; secondly, that she should
be permitted to shroud her features and person in a
veil during the marriage ceremony. Without inquiring
the meaning of these requests, which, indeed, she
partly conjectured, Aveline promised ready compliance;
and her adviser left her, but not till he had once more
proffered her the supposed philter, and caused her to
place the cup containing it to her lips.</p>

<p>Ere long, he was succeeded by Sir Francis, arrayed
like a bridegroom, in doublet and hose of white satin,
thickly laid with silver lace, and a short French mantle
of sky-blue velvet, branched with silver flowers, white
roses in his shoes, and drooping white plumes, arranged
<em>à l’Espagnolle</em>, in his hat. Besides this, he was trimmed,
curled, oiled, and would have got himself ground young
again, had such a process been practicable.</p>

<p>But though he could not effect this, he did the next
thing to it, and employed all the restoratives suggested
by Luke Hatton. He bathed in milk, breakfasted on
snail-broth, and swallowed a strange potion prepared
for him by the apothecary, which the latter affirmed
would make a new man of him and renovate all his
youthful ardour. It certainly had produced an extraordinary
effect; and when he presented himself before
Aveline, his gestures were so extravagant, and his
looks so wild and unpleasant, that it was with the
utmost difficulty she repressed a scream. His cheeks
were flushed, as if with fever, and his eyes dilated
and burning with unnatural lustre. He spoke almost
incoherently, tossing his arms about, and performing
the antics of a madman. The philter, it was clear,
had been given him, and he was now under its influence.</p>

<p>Amid all this strange frenzy, so alarming to Aveline,
he dwelt upon nothing but his inextinguishable
passion, and never for a moment withdrew his fevered
gaze from her. He told her he would be her slave for
life, proud to wear her chains; and that she should be
absolute mistress of his house and all his possessions.
On this she mustered up resolution to prefer the requests
she had been counselled to make; and Sir
Francis, who was in no mood to refuse her anything,
at once acceded to them. He laughed at the notion
of the veil — said it was a delicate fancy, and quite
charmed him — but as to the ten thousand marks,
they were utterly unworthy of her acceptance, and she
should have thrice the amount delivered to her in a
silver coffer before the ceremony. With these, and a
great many other professions, he released her from his
presence, which had become well-nigh insupportable.</p>

<p>After a while, a magnificent bridal-dress of white
satin, richly trimmed with lace, together with a thick
white veil of the largest size, calculated to envelope
her whole person, were brought her by a young damsel,
who told her she was engaged to serve her as
tire-woman; adding, that “she hoped she would be
able to satisfy her ladyship, as she had already served
the Countess of Exeter in that capacity.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call me ‘ladyship’ child?” said Aveline,
without looking at her. “I have no right to any
such title.”</p>

<p>“But you soon will have,” replied the young tire-woman;
“as the bride of Sir Francis, you must needs
be my Lady Mitchell.”</p>

<p>Checking the rejoinder that rose to her lips, Aveline
cast her eyes, for the first time, on the speaker;
and then, to her great surprise, perceived it to be her
village acquaintance, Gillian Greenford. A significant
glance from the blue eyes of the pretty damsel impressed
her with the necessity of caution, and seemed
to intimate that Gillian herself was likewise in the plot.
And so it presently appeared she was; for when the
damsel had an opportunity of talking quite in private
to her new mistress, she informed her of the real motive
of her coming there.</p>

<p>“I am engaged, by one who wishes you well, to
take your place, sweet Mistress Aveline, and to be
married in your stead to Sir Francis Mitchell,” she
said.</p>

<p>“And have you really consented to such an arrangement?”
rejoined Aveline. “Is it possible you can
sacrifice yourself thus?”</p>

<p>“I am not to be sacrificed,” returned the damsel
quickly. “If it were so, I would never have agreed
to the scheme. But I am told I shall get a fortune,
and —”</p>

<p>“Oh, then the ten thousand marks are for you!”
interrupted the other. “I now see the meaning of that
part of the plan. But what else do you hope to accomplish?”</p>

<p>“The deliverance of my unfortunate lover, Dick
Taverner, from the Fleet,” she answered.</p>

<p>“But how is your marrying this wicked old usurer
to effect your object?” inquired Aveline. “You may
save me by the proposed stratagem; but you will destroy
your own happiness, and all your lover’s hopes.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I shall not,” replied Gillian, hastily; “I
can’t tell how it’s to be managed, but I am quite sure
no harm will happen to me, and that Dick’s restoration
to liberty will be the reward of the service — if such
it may be called — that I am about to render you.
He wrote to me so himself.”</p>

<p>“At least, tell me by whom you are engaged, and
I can then judge of the probability of the rest happening
in the way you anticipate?”</p>

<p>“Do not question me further, sweet mistress,” replied
the damsel, “for I am bound to secrecy. But
thus much I may declare — I am the agent of one
who, for some purposes of his own — be they what
they may — is determined to counteract all Sir Francis’s
vile machinations against you, as well as those of
his partner, Sir Giles Mompesson, against your lover,
Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey. Ah! you understand me now,
I perceive, sweet mistress! You have been guarded by
this unseen but watchful friend, during the whole of
your confinement in this dreadful habitation; and he
has kept an equal watch over your lover in the Fleet.”</p>

<p>“What! Is Sir Jocelyn a prisoner in the Fleet?”
exclaimed Aveline. “I knew it not!”</p>

<p>“He is; but the period of his deliverance approaches,”
replied Gillian. “The secret friend I spoke
of has bided his time, and the hour is at hand when
full measure of revenge will be dealt upon those two
wicked oppressors. He has long worked towards it;
and I myself, am to be an humble instrument towards
the great end.”</p>

<p>“You astonish me!” cried Aveline, greatly surprised
at the change in the damsel’s manner as well
as by what she said.</p>

<p>“Do not perplex yourself, fair mistress,” pursued
Gillian. “All will be speedily made known to you.
But now, no more time must be lost, and we must
each assume the character we have to enact. As I
am to be the bride, and you the tire-woman, you must
condescend to aid me in putting on these rich robes
and then disguise yourself in my rustic attire. We
are both pretty nearly of a size, so there is little risk
of detection in that particular; and if you can but
conceal your features for a short while, on Sir Francis’s
entrance, the trick will never be discovered. All
the rest has been arranged; and I am a mere puppet
in the hands of others, to be played as they direct.
Bless us! how beautiful this dress is, to-be-sure! —
what satin! — and what lace! The Countess of Exeter
has just such another. Have you heard that her ladyship
has gained her cause against those wicked Lakes,
who conspired against her? But what am I saying —
when I know you cannot have heard of it! Well, then,
it occupied five days in the Star-Chamber; and Sir
Thomas and his lady are sent to the Tower, and
Sarah Swarton to the Fleet. Poor creature! she is to
be whipped and branded, and to do penance in Saint
Martin’s church. Dreadful! but I won’t think of it.
I wonder how this dress will become me! How
astounded Dick Taverner would be, if he could only
see me in it! Mayhap he will — there’s no saying.
And now, fair mistress, may I crave your aid?”</p>

<p>While Gillian was thus running on, she had partially
disrobed herself, and very soon afterwards was
decked out in the rich attire, the effect of which upon
her own person she was so desirous of ascertaining.
When her toilet was complete, she could not help
running up to a mirror, and on seeing the reflection
of her well-formed figure now displayed to unwonted
advantage, she clapped her hands and cried out with
girlish delight.</p>

<p>Allowing her to gratify her feelings of vanity by
the contemplation of her pretty person for a few minutes,
Aveline felt it necessary to recal her to her situation,
and her own transformation into the tire-woman
was speedily effected, — Gillian’s dress fitting
her exactly. The light-hearted damsel was quite as
much pleased with this change as with the other —
and vowed that Aveline looked far better in the rustic
gown, than she herself did in the silken attire.</p>

<p>But time pressed; and as Sir Francis might surprise
them, they hastened to complete their arrangements.
Gillian’s comely features, as well as her
sumptuous robe, had to be obscured by the envious
veil; and as it was thrown over her, she could not
help heaving a sigh. Aveline then put on the muffler
which had been worn by the country damsel, and their
disguises were complete.</p>

<p>Not a minute too soon. At this juncture a tap was
heard at a door communicating with the adjoining
apartment, and the voice of the old usurer was heard
inquiring whether his bride was ready. An answer in
the affirmative was given by Aveline, and, with a
throbbing heart and faltering steps, Gillian prepared
to obey the summons.</p>

<p>The door was thrown open, and mustering up all
her resolution, she passed through it. Both Sir Francis
and his partner were waiting to receive her. The
latter was richly attired, but had not changed the
sombre hue of his habiliments, even for the anticipated
ceremonial, being clad, as usual, in black. In this
respect he offered marked contrast to the gay apparel
of the antiquated bridegroom, as well as by the calmness
of his deportment and the stern gravity of his
looks. Behind them stood Luke Hatton, bearing a
heavy silver coffer, of antique workmanship.</p>

<p>“What means this veil?” cried Sir Giles, gazing
suspiciously at Gillian as she emerged from the inner
room, followed cautiously by Aveline, who was wrapped
in the muffler. “Why are the bride’s features thus
hidden?”</p>

<p>“A mere whim, Sir Giles — a pleasant fancy,”
replied the old usurer. “But she must have her way.
I mean to indulge her in everything.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” rejoined the extortioner. “Make
her feel you will be her master. Bid her take it off.”</p>

<p>“On no account whatever, Sir Giles. I have only
won her by submission, and shall I spoil all at the
last moment, by opposing her inclinations? Of a
truth not.”</p>

<p>“Who is the maiden with her?” demanded Sir
Giles, scrutinizing Aveline, with a keen glance.” Why
does she wear a muffler? Is that a whim, likewise?”</p>

<p>“Perchance it is,” replied Sir Francis; “but I have
given no consent to it. She is only the tire-woman.”</p>

<p>“Come, mistress, unmuffle. Let us see your face,”
cried Sir Giles, striding towards the terrified maiden,
who thought discovery was now inevitable.</p>

<p>But Luke Hatton interposed to save her.</p>

<p>“Prevent this rudeness,” he whispered, plucking
Sir Francis’s cloak. “Prevent it instantly. If her
whim be thwarted, I will not answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Desist, Sir Giles — desist, I pray you!” cried
the old usurer, in alarm. “It is my bride’s wish that
her attendant be not interfered with — and mine too.”</p>

<p>“Well, be it as you will,” replied the extortioner,
testily. “But I would not permit the impertinence
were I in your case. The bride must raise her veil
when she stands before the priest.”</p>

<p>“She shall do as she pleases,” replied Sir Francis,
gallantly. “If she desires to hide her blushes, I will
not put any compulsion upon her to disclose them.
Come, fair mistress,” he added, taking the trembling
hand of the veiled maiden, “the priest awaits us in
the further chamber, where the ceremony is to take
place, and where several of the noble and illustrious
guests who have consented to grace our nuptials are
already assembled. Some of the most illustrious personages
in the land will be present — the Marquis of
Buckingham, and perhaps Prince Charles himself.
His Excellency the Spanish Ambassador has promised
to come. Let us on, then. Yet, ere we proceed further,
I have to request your acceptance of that silver
coffer. The thirty thousand marks within it constitute
your dowry.”</p>

<p>As he spoke Luke Hatton advanced, and, holding
the coffer towards the veiled damsel, so that she could
touch it, said — “Place your hand upon this silver
box, and take possession of it, fair mistress. I am a
witness that Sir Francis Mitchell has freely bestowed
it, with its contents, upon you. It will remain in my
custody till you require me to deliver it up to you.”</p>
