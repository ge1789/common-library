<!-- Chapter 9 -->
<p>The charming and tastefully-costumed waitresses of Crossby Hall were quite used to hearing extravagant language from their City customers at times. The young lady who was attending to their wants came behind them at this moment and heard the dark words which Anthony had uttered so deliberately. But she was neither horrified nor surprised. She had listened to more blood-curdling threats before from irate financial gentlemen when the market went crooked for them. It was within forty-eight hours of settling day, and one half of the diners there present were, in consequence, cursing someone or something.</p>
<p>Both Anthony and Maddox had sat at the same table pretty frequently, and were on familiar enough terms to speak to her by her Christian name, which was the pretty one, “Violet.”</p>
<p>She touched Anthony lightly on the elbow and said,--</p>
<p>“Keep your collar on, clear boy, and make a clean job of it when you do <i>suppress</i> that foe of yours. No gore, you know, or nothing ugly of that sort.”</p>
<p>Anthony laughed grimly.</p>
<p>“Right you are, Violet, my angel. I’ll keep my hands as clean as possible.”</p>
<p>“Sell him with some rotten shares. That’s the safest way of suppressing an enemy.”</p>
<p>“I’ll think of it, Violet; meantime, bring us two coffees with Cognac.”</p>
<p>“Two Cognacs also?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and one of your best cigars.”</p>
<p>“There is a gentleman three tables behind who looks as if he was thinking about suppressing you, dear boy,” whispered Violet, as she glided off to execute the order just given to her.</p>
<p>Anthony glanced behind him and uttered a savage oath.</p>
<p>“Curse me, if Long isn’t over there, and looking as black as thunder at us.”</p>
<p>“I have been watching him since we entered,” replied Maddox, calmly. “Yes, your plan is about the only one left, as far as he is concerned. But I hope you don’t expect me to take any hand in this game? It is entirely out of my line.”</p>
<p>“I know. Moral courage is your strong point, Maddox, not physical. You don’t care to risk that precious skin of yours, dear boy, do you?”</p>
<p>“You are quite right. I don’t, and don’t ever intend to do so, if I can possibly avoid it.”</p>
<p>“And there is no necessity that you should do so; I have other tools for that kind of work. It must be done, though, before my next prospectus is published. His rag is out to-day, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Have you seen a copy?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Anything about me in it?”</p>
<p>“Not a word.”</p>
<p>“Then, next week’s issue will be a black-bordered one if there are any more issues of that financial censor. I’ll have him settled to-night.”</p>
<p>Mr Edward Long, the incorruptible editor and proprietor of <i>The Financial Watch-dog</i>, was a fair-haired, good-looking man of about thirty-two, with a frank expression, although at this moment considerably clouded, as he looked at the well-known speculator. He was the most level-headed, best hated, and most feared editor who dealt in money matters, and his paper, although not much advertised in, was the one that City men looked the most eagerly out for. He was known to be honest, a deadly sin in a financial editor, and beyond bribery, which made him an object of dire hatred and dread to company promoters in general, and a standing reproach mainly to those Of his less upright journalistic compeers. Hardly anyone had a good word to say for him inside that tolerated gambling hell, the Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>At several of the tables the diners were playing matador for cups of coffee; since the law had prohibited playing for money, drinks and coffee now were the innocent stakes.</p>
<p>The police constantly raided clubs and pounced upon unlucky book-makers. At last the paternal Government had opened its eyes to the iniquity and misery Of gambling.</p>
<p>This was quite right, and what civilisation and social morality demanded. A gambler must always be but one remove from a thief; whether better or worse the indulgent reader must decide for himself. He has broken the tenth commandment when he makes his bet. To break the eighth is a natural sequence; in fact, the tenth generally precedes the eighth.</p>
<p>Ruin, disaster, dishonour and death nestle amongst the cards and ride with the horses, so that it is quite right to make betting an offence against society.</p>
<p>But when is the Stock Exchange to be handed over to the police? Where one fool is ruined at baccarat, or on the turf, thousands of innocent victims are sent to perdition by the ruthless company promoter. We don’t do things consistently in England. We imprison housebreakers and pickpockets, but we permit these worse thieves and deeper villains to flourish unchecked.</p>
<p>Edward Long had set himself a Herculean task, almost single handed, to protect, as far as he could, the trusting public against these privileged confidence trick swindlers. He was a man of vast experience in City ways, and had dived deeply into the financial cesspool. No man knew better than he did the <i>bonâ fide</i> exploiters and those who dealt in balloons. He had a system all his own for discovering rotten speculations, no matter how they were disguised, and he had the honesty to expose them ruthlessly.</p>
<p>His eagle eye had been for some time most unpleasantly directed towards Anthony Bigger and his gang. He had openly announced that he intended to hound that gentleman off the field. It was therefore a duel between the pair, in which, as far as open fighting was concerned, the editor had all the advantages. A promoter, in one respect, resembles a lady. To be talked about dubiously means social ruin. He is ten thousand times more sensitive to an adverse criticism than the most touchy of authors or actors.</p>
<p>Mr Long saw that his presence disturbed his enemy greatly, and he enjoyed the situation as much as a detective enjoys the embarrassment of an unconvicted thief who recognises him. He looked sternly at the pair, particularly at Maddox Bouncer, who had tried to corrupt him; but he did not feel so angry as he looked. He was merely making a mental note to discover what their next game would be in good time, so that he might mar it.</p>
<p>No premonition of what the actual project was crossed his mind. He would have laughed had anyone suggested it to him at that moment. Like most sensible men in this advanced nineteenth century, Edward Long would have repudiated the idea of assassination being employed by a City man. He read his papers, of course, and glanced over the murder news. Bodies were picked up weekly in the river, and men were waylaid and done to death in the side streets and lanes, just about as frequently as they had been in the days of Benvenuto Cellini. It was ridiculous, however, for anyone to imagine for a moment that any of these victims had been put out of the way for interfering with business.</p>
<p>Maddox Bouncer was facing him with his customary look ,of superiority and insufferable rectitude. He knew Bouncer fairly well,“and despised his superficial qualities and priggish vanity too utterly to think him capable of doing much harm to anyone, except, of course, by calumny. He was a flagrant liar and a dirty cur, this same Maddox, but by all who knew him he was considered a harmless enough blackmailer and hanger-on to the
more daring swindler beside him. Mr Long’s opinion of Anthony Bigger was as bad as it could be, but then he only knew the speculative side of that gentleman’s criminal character.</p>
<p>“I expect Bigger has some fresh swindle up his sleeve now that he has returned. I must find out what it is and go for him. Yes, I’ll give him an article next week and warn those whom it concerns that he has got back.”</p>
<p>To meditate upon that coming article imparted a new flavour to his cigarette, and gave this faithful editorial detective as much pleasure as a tasty bone might give to a chained-up watch-dog.</p>
<p>While the financial editor was enjoying this tit-bit, Anthony Bigger’s office boy entered with a bundle of telegrams in his hand, and shaped his course towards the table where his employer sat. He was a pallid, thin-visaged lad of about fifteen, with a decidedly prominent nose and sharp, restless black eyes which appeared to take in everything.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Mark,” said Anthony, taking the envelopes from his boy; then he added in a low tone, “Do you see that party sitting by himself three tables behind me?”</p>
<p>“D’ye mean Long of the <i>Watch-dog</i>, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Do you know him, Mark?”</p>
<p>“I should say so, sir. There’s not many men connected with “’Change” as I don’t know by
sight.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right. I want you to point him out to someone to-night. Have you had lunch?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Then go and get something to eat, after which go to Waterloo Station and wait on the Surbiton Platform until I come.”</p>
<p>He gave the boy half a crown, who received it calmly, and, with another swift glance at Mr Long, he went back the way he had come.</p>
<p>Mark Daniels did not get a half-crown every day from his master. He was sharp enough also to know that he should not be in possession of this one if there wasn’t some extra work before him. From what his master had said, he connected it with the happily unconscious Mr Long.</p>
<p>“I know where the boss is going this afternoon, so he may just as well have sent me. It’s to Loppy Turpin in the New-Cut, and it’s him I’m to be pointer to. Well, if Loppy is put on the job, it’s U P with Long and the <i>Watch-dog</i>. No more exposures of City swindlers in that paper, I guess, and it’s just about time they was put an end to.”</p>
<p>This office boy knew his master better than most of his Stock Exchange friends did; but knowledge had not brought contempt. Indeed, his sole ambition was to follow the bright example set by that master. To catch gulls he considered to be one of the finest pursuits going, and he had all the inborn hatred and indignation against virtuous editors that youthful Hooligans have for policemen.</p>
<p>“I’ll just lay about and see where the gov’nor goes. If it’s to Loppy, then I know wot game’s on and will be prepared to take a hand. I can easily follow him and reach the station before he can get there.”</p>
<p>He crossed the street and entered a tea shop, the front door of which commanded a view of Crossby Hall. Here he ordered a bun and a glass of milk, and while he partook of his humble lunch he watched the entrance opposite.</p>
<p>Before he was through with his glass of milk he saw his master and Maddox come out together and stand talking on the kerbstone. Anthony was looking up and down the street.</p>
<p>Being an intuitive boy, Mark knew that his master was looking for a cab, and he instantly left his milk and sauntered over to the pair.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mark! just the fellow I wanted. Get me a cab, will you?”</p>
<p>Mark soon found what was wanted, and came back alongside of it.</p>
<p>“There you are, sir.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mark. Tell him to drive to Waterloo Bridge. Well, ta-ta, Maddox; you know what to do. I’ll be back at the office before you leave. Don’t go till I come, as I’d like to go over that with you before sending it to the printer.”</p>
<p>Mr Edward Long passed them at this moment and heard the last words. He smiled grimly.</p>
<p>“Another bogus company to be foisted on the public. I’ll have a look at the proof before he does,” he murmured inwardly.</p>
<p>He had promised himself a quiet evening at home that night, but the words about the printer roused up his hunting instincts. He would wait in town instead, and have a look at that new prospectus. He therefore went into the nearest telegraph office and wired to his wife, at Surbiton, not to expect him home till the last train.</p>
<p>Possibly it did not matter much whether he spent that evening at home or in the City with Anthony Bigger on the trail. He made it a little easier for his enemy by taking the last train. But doubtless some expedient would have been resorted to to lure him from his house had he been there. There is no evading Destiny.</p>
<p>When Mark saw his master drive away he said to himself,--</p>
<p>“It’s all right. He is going to see Loppy, so I know whom I have to meet at the station, and wot’s to be done afterwards.”</p>
<p>He proceeded along Cornhill in a leisurely fashion, whistling cheerily, with his keen black eyes roving over the faces of the passers-by.</p>
<p>At the bank corner he met a telegraph lad whom he owed a grudge against. He promptly wiped that debt out by knocking off the official cap and kicking it amongst the ’bus horses’ feet. By the time the boy recovered his cap Mark had entered a tobacconist’s shop. The telegraph messenger crammed on his hat, and as he had no leisure for revenge just then, he entered this insult on his mental tablets for another occasion. Boys can always sup their revenge cold.</p>
<p>Mark Daniels, being in the shop, expended some of his half-crown on a packet of cigarettes, then, lighting one, he strolled along Cheapside, as free from care as any embryo company promoter could be.</p>
