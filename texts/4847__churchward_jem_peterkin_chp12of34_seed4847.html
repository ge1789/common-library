<meta charset="utf-8">

<!-- chapter entitled "The Rival" -->
<p>
Meanwhile the time that passed so pleasantly for Jack had been to his rival a period of jealous torture.
The sight of that hat bearing the regimental colours, the thought that the old man had played with and
deceived him, and that Brett was in the house all the time wrought his fierce nature to a very frenzy
of jealous spite.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at barracks he went through the whole range of quarters to make sure of his surmise by seeing
if his rival were anywhere about, and found the Major and Jack only unaccounted for.
</p>
<p>
He retired to his room with gleaming eyes and rising passion; the Major was out of the question—and for
the other!—A red mist seemed to float before his eyes, and such a sudden fury of rage and hatred flamed
up within him as for the moment frightened even himself.
</p>
<p>
If Jemima had promised herself, her love, her fortune to the man he loathed and detested, that promise
should never, never be kept! Sooner would he take the sin of murder on his soul.—Kill her or her lover
or both—than stand by and let that marriage take place.
</p>
<p>
When his frenzy had a little calmed down, he took up his post on the verandah, with some vague idea of
seeing his foe arrive, and judging what fortune he had met with from his face.
</p>
<p>
“The young fool’s features tell all” he cried contemptuously, “If she has said ‘yes’ he will come in like
a very bridegroom, if ‘no’ the fact will be patent in his hang-dog looks.”
</p>
<p>
All in barracks but he were stridently jubilant over the thoughts of active service and the youthful regimental
ardour was at bursting point as the fun, as they called it, was loudly commented upon, that would be experienced
when the row began and bullets were flying thick.
</p>
<p>
Little cared the Signor for Maori fighting then, but as his ear caught some youngster’s silly remark anent
“wigs on the green” he thought how he should feel indebted to the foe if a certain wig that fitted the hat
he had seen tha morning were laid low through them.
</p>
<p>
An irresistible wave of malevolence raged through him at this thought as he muttered under his breath, “And,
by Jove! I’ll join the Maories myself before I’m baulked should to-morrow bring me defeat.”
</p>
<p>
His moody watching was in time rewarded by the sight, first of the Major moving in and out in critical survey
amongst the squads drilling on the parade ground, and shortly afterwards by that of the other absentee, who
came carelessly strolling through the gate with a pleasant smile and a nod for everyone in his path, the
tell-tale hat thrust back on his curly head and looking as happy, handsome, and good-natured a fellow as lover
could wish to see or rival fear.
</p>
<p>
He noticed Fraser as he lightly sprang up the verandah steps with the usual friendly nod and salutation, in
recognition of which he received something that sounded very like a malediction which very nearly made him
stop. A rapid second thought however bade him continue on to the mess-room wondering what had made the man
so extra savage that morning.
</p>
<p>
The irrepressible Boots saved him the trouble of starting that subject, by exclaiming as soon as he saw him,
“I say Brett, what have you been doing to our noble foreigner? Relations strained eh? Since he went out just
before you to-day he bas lost what little civility he had left. Talk about snubbing, one gets much worse than
that now in real, ripe double-shotted Roman.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s queer,” replied Jack, “I was just going to ask some of you chaps about that. As I passed him only a
moment since, in exchange for my polite salutation I got what sounded like a very liberal cursing. Committed
any more little indiscretions, Reggie?”
</p>
<p>
“Not I,” replied the youngster. “I don’t intend to either. One edition like the last is enough for me. But we
really thought that you had put the Signor’s nose out of joint somehow or other and drew our conclusions from
seeing you both steering the same course this morning.”
</p>
<p>
Then seeing Jack make an involuntary motion of disapproval he continued apologetically, “There, I won’t ask any
more questions. I’m always saying too much, can’t help it somehow.”
</p>
<p>
The news came as a sudden revelation to Jack and made him thoughtful for the moment. It perhaps would account
for the morning’s mysteries.
</p>
<p>
“What if the Signor,” thought he, “was the unknown individual to whom old Peterkin had found it so perplexing
to give an answer; and if so, what was that question he had asked? Yes it must have been Fraser who was in the
‘den’ that very morning: and what if the old man had looked favourably upon what he was sure had been the request?”
</p>
<p>
“What a fool I was, not to go to Peterkin and secure his good word on the spot,” continued he, “Bother it all!
I hope there is no harm done.”
</p>
<p>
Reggie Bareham was not slow in noticing the cloud that had overshadowed his friend and fearing that he must have
been its cause he drew Jack into an adjoining room and as soon as they found themselves alone with many excuses
disburdened his mind.
</p>
<p>
I’m so sorry,” said he, “I didn’t mean to annoy you, it’s all my confounded tongue that will run off with me
at any moment. I’d made up my mind to see you alone but must needs let off before all the chaps. You won’t mind.
Will you?—my saying that all along I’ve watched you and Miss Peterkin with a dead certainty of what would come
about. Don’t think it impertinent, but really it must have been quite as apparent to many others. I also saw
what you didn’t I fancy, that there was another ‘Richmond’ in the field, and many a time I’ve seen him take
interest in your proceedings, but it was not till I got into yesterday’s shindy that I thought of warning you.
That involuntary outburst told its tale, and his glance when I suggested in joke that someone had cut him out
showed what mercy anyone would get who stood in his way. It was, Jack, a very devil of a look. I shall never
forget it. For the moment it was too malignant that its mere recollection makes me shudder every time I pass
its owner. I know he’ll do some great mischief one of these days. He can’t help it, it’s born in him. This
morning strolling on the hill I happened to see you two go to Peterkin’s almost together, and from Fraser
returning alone in such a diabolical temper I concluded that you must have had an unpleasant minute or two
with him there.”
</p>
<p>
“No, my dear boy, I never saw him,” replied Jack, “but his presence there explains, though it doesn’t clear
up, something that has puzzled me a great deal. And thank you for your care of me. I know it springs from
true regard, and now, I don’t mind telling you, but don’t let it go further till you get the word, that it
is as you think with Miss Peterkin and me. As for Fraser with his likes and dislikes I don’t care a pin. Let
him play fairly or otherwise, I’m not alarmed, though I must say there are many men who would be much pleasanter
to fight than he. I know his measure to a shave and don’t fear his malice in the least, and further whilst
I’m in the humour I’ll go and have it out with him for cursing me.”
</p>
<p>
Jack turned to leave the room when “Boots” burst in suddenly with:
</p>
<p>
“For Heaven’s sake don’t go and quarrel with him, Brett! You can’t imagine what mischief I’m always fancying
about that man, and it’s not open danger that I fear. I tell you that I have developed a perfect horror of
him and his ways. I don’t think I’m really afraid of anything living or dead but of him, and that I can’t help.
He will be mixed up in our future somehow I feel sure, and in no pleasant manner either, so for goodness’ sake
don’t tackle him before that time comes.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Jack laughing lightly at the boy’s fears. “Perhaps it will be as well, so I won’t say anything
now, but let the beggar go his own way while I go mine. But by Jingo! I’ll stand no more swearing quietly.”
</p>
<p>
The two then, arm in arm, returned to the anteroom, where the first individual who accosted them was the very
one they had just been discussing. To their great surprise they found that he had sought them to make excuses
for the hasty language he had used to Jack in the verandah, saying that at the time he was so much bothered
with something on his mind that he didn’t know what he said.
</p>
<p>
Jack, cheerfully accepted the explanation whilst “Boots” whose presence was completely ignored, absolutely
whistled with surprise, and, as Fraser passed on he said to his companion, “I don’t think it is on record that
an apology ever came from that quarter before. I should feel much safer under an extra anathema or two. Be careful
Jack, old fellow; he has not put himself in the wrong for nothing.
</p>
<p>
“As for me, did you remark? I’m not considered worth powder and shot, but all the same I feel sure that he
would not be displeased to insert some of the latter in my unfortunate carcass. He would murder me if he
dared, I’m confident.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk such rubbish, Reggie, he can do you no harm beyond being disagreeable so think no more about him.
But there goes the first mess bugle. I’m off to dress and if you don’t want to be late you will do the same.”
</p>
<p>
That evening the dinner passed off in a much more lively manner than usual, the whole regiment being in high
spirits at the thoughts of getting into action at last. Even Fraser seemed to catch the general enthusiasm
conversing specially with Jack Brett who honestly returned his advances, and although he never suspected any
scheming, his “fidus Achates” did, and closely did Reggie Bareham watch the course of the newfound friendship.”
</p>
<p>
He soon noticed that the Signor during the whole evening, never once let his friend out of his sight until he
saw him safely within the doors of his own rooms for the night, then he surlily retired himself, eased in mind
to think that at least if he were not winning Jack was not making any running either.
</p>
<p>
Jealously as he was exercised with anticipations for the morrow he slept but badly that night and in his
restlessness his heated vision saw fair pictures of his rival and Jemima happy and contented in each other’s
love, and himself a wretched outcast, despised and pitied, for his failure, and over and over again he
vowed that it should not be till after he had exhausted all his resources of interference that these pictures
should become reality.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, the minute that parade was over, without even waiting to change his clothes, he went straight
off to the Lodge for the decision of his fate and was duly ushered into the “den” where he found the old
gentleman awaiting him smoking vigorously in front of a half-consumed jorum of rum and water standing on the
plain boarded table.
</p>
<p>
The state of the room plainly showed that that had not been his only occupation; all his pet objects, instead
of being neatly and handily in their places, were lying about anyhow, taken down from their niches without any
object and left anywhere.
</p>
<p>
The master was in fact in a great state of mental perturbation, more so indeed than the day before. He had made
sure that the time of reprieve he had exacted from the Signor would have furnished him with some sort of answer
to his embarrassing applications, that during the lull, certain desirable revelations would have been made which
in themselves would have supplied a convincing response.
</p>
<p>
He had thought that Jemima, Jack, or someone, no matter who, would have brought him the news he was so anxious
to get and remained in the “den” some hours longer than usual so as to be in the way when wanted.
</p>
<p>
At last his impatience mastered him and off he stepped on a voyage of discovery for himself and found the two
ladies quietly seated in the boudoir, who in spite of the plainest of hints seemed to have nothing particular
to say beyond that Brett had not been able to stop on account of being due for some duty.
</p>
<p>
That morning, in despair of getting any assistance from his people, he early sought inspiration amongst his
beloved relics unconsciously handling and displacing them till all was in a state of confusion similar to that
of his own mind but at last he deserted his playthings and with a groan of “Worse luck” he took a pull at his
grog, fixed his pipe more firmly and sat down to await his visitor.
</p>
<p>
It was at that very moment that Fraser made his appearance, and seizing upon the old man’s remark for a
conversational opening as he shook hands he briskly said:
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, Sir! And what’s the matter with luck this morning? Surely you haven’t to complain of that
unequally distributed commodity? Hope it isn’t mine that is on the decline.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know anything about your luck,” said the host testily and without rising. “All I know is that
everything about this house seems to have gone mad, and getting worse every moment. I’ll be hanged if there’s
a sane person about the shanty or even visiting it.”
</p>
<p>
This petulant sally of the old whaler emphasized as it was with professional flourishes of a favourite harpoon
that stood to hand, did not have the smallest effect on the listener who contented himself with smilingly
inquiring “if he were not considered sane?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” was the immediate unceremonious return, snappy and rude, “Not one bit more than any other chap that
comes loafing round here. ‘Pon my soul you are not so sane as most of them or you wouldn’t come bothering
for an answer I don’t want to give—That’s plain—Why, in the name of goodness can’t you fellows leave me
and my girl alone?”
</p>
<p>
In his strong disinclination to give Fraser anything but an unfavourable answer Peterkin had managed to walk
himself into a sort of injured feeling, with no fixed aim, though perhaps in it there lurked a sort of
calculation that an exhibition of temper might disgust his visitor and choke him off; but in that he had
sadly mistaken his man, who not disturbed in the slightest degree calmly responded:
</p>
<p>
“I can assure you, Sir, that I’m sorry indeed to be a bother. Perhaps I should have done better to ascertain
Miss Peterkin’s sentiments before coming to you, and that might have—though I have not the boldness to think
so—precluded the necessity of troubling further. I thought however that it was due to you to first ascertain
your ideas as to my fitness to be your daughter’s husband, and hope I have satisfied you.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing the old man half turn away with a most rudely evident shrug, Fraser continued with rising heat, though
struggling hard to control his infirmity of temper that he felt getting the better of him. “But pardon my saying
that even if I am not fortunate enough to obtain your good word I must strive my utmost to win Miss Peterkin.
Indeed, Sir, I love her too much to give her up with life. I can’t and won’t! I’m sure you would not refuse your
sanction should Miss Jemima desire it as I do. I must and will have her!” he cried, getting more and more excited
with his own speech. “I can’t do without her now and if she is not to be mine she shall be no one else’s.”
</p>
<p>
Every fighting drop of the old sailor’s blood rose at this passionate declamation. The crimson battle flag
showed defiantly in his flushed face as he glared in heated indignation at his visitor, struggling hard to
overcome the jealous excitement that had served him so badly.
</p>
<p>
Fraser had seen in a moment the damage he had done and with numerous apologies endeavoured to lessen the effect
of his unlucky burst of nature, but it was no use, for apart from just resentment Peterkin saw his chance and
determined to avail himself of it and cutting short the flow of explanation he burst out scornfully:
</p>
<p>
“Hoity-toity! That’s tall talk from a stranger asking a favour!—And you’ll have my girl whether I like it or
not. Will you? And murder anybody who may be selected in preference to your pompous self, eh! I’ll recollect
that for further use in case anyone should lose the number of his mess. You’ll have lots of practice if you
have to settle all who are fond of Jemima.”
</p>
<p>
A short pause for breath ensued but before Fraser could say a word the irate old fellow followed up bitterly:
</p>
<p>
” I like your style of courting immensely, there’s no awkward bashfulness about it. I only wish that you would
go and tell my girl half you have said to me. I should have nothing to fear about the result, and since you
have been so kind as to threaten to totally disregard me if I don’t do what you want, I think I’ll give you the
chance—No I won’t though,” said he, suddenly stopping and thinking for a moment. “I promised that you should
see her and I scorn to go back on my word whatever happens. But I tell you plainly, Captain Fraser, that I am
in hopes that a man I like much better than you, will secure, if he has not already done so, the affections of
my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
This was indeed bitter to the listener who with lowering brows essayed to speak, but fruitlessly, for Peterkin
was thoroughly wound up for the occasion and would not be denied.
</p>
<p>
“Now don’t interrupt me,” he continued, “or you shall not put your chance to the test at all. I’ve promised that
you shall have the same chance of winning as any other man. And further I say again that the girl shall decide
for herself and her choice is mine and her mother’s. Now don’t speak any more or I might change my mind, but be
off, find the girl, and do your best. You need not look me up after you’ve got your answer. I know what it will
be now. But recollect another thing I told you yesterday, namely, that the girl’s negative must be taken for
good and all. If it isn’t I shall have something more to say. There go. I’ve said all I mean to, and may be a
little too much, but I mean it all.”
</p>
<p>
Ironically bowed out, Fraser heartily cursing the hasty temper that had exposed him to such an experience of
shameful vituperation, that he never could have believed himself capable of enduring, proceeded in an angry
but resolute frame of mind, backed up by his never-failing assurance, down the passage to the boudoir.
</p>
<p>
He was his vigorous self again before he had gone ten steps. He had been rudely handled but yet might avoid
defeat. He <em>could not</em> stand that. The old man’s jeering had made him feel ten thousand times more
the necessity of scoring a victory. The stinging jibes he had suffered with strange effect on his wild
unbalanced nature had spurred him to imagine that he loved Jemima with more maddening fervour than ever, and
yet that love now acted but as a secondary impulse. The premier was that inordinate overpowering arrogant
self-estimation that he could not control, that would brook no yielding to either man or circumstance without
the bitterest strife. “Circumstances might conquer” thought he. “They might keep beyond his control, but no
man should bring about for him such degrading failure and triumph in it.” Determining grimly thus, unthinkingly,
without even the ceremony of knocking, he burst into the ladies’ sanctum whither no one penetrated save by favour.
</p>
<p>
He found here Mrs. Peterkin and her three Maori friends in solemn conclave, and as the old lady started to her
feet on his unexpected intrusion, Fraser saw in her flashing looks the mistake he had made, that his wretched
ungovernable temper had arraigned against him a hitherto neutral force upon which he had counted, not a little,
to help him to stem the flowing tide of disaster.
</p>
<p>
Stammering out a confused apology in answer to Matu-huere’s inquiring looks, he informed her that her husband
had sent him to find her daughter, and then not seeing her there, he respectfully inquired where she was.
</p>
<p>
Without noticing his excuses she answered in as curt a manner as possible and in tones of unmistakable unwelcome
that Jemima was in the garden, where she might be found if her father’s permission had been obtained.
</p>
<p>
This reception, though provoked, and the pronounced contemptuous hostility of the old lady’s answer was almost
too much for Fraser, to whose lips there arose a retort which even the certainty of total discomfiture scarcely
was able to suppress. That a parcel of “niggers” should treat him thus was almost too much, and for the first
time in his life he made a sacrifice to his masterfulness, with a great effort thrust back the surging
retort, hurriedly thanked the speaker and left the room for the garden in search of the girl.
