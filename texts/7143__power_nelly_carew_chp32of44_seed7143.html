<!-- chapter heading: ASHBOURNE. -->

<p>It was settled that as soon as Maggie should be able to undertake the fatigue of the journey she should go, accompanied by Nelly, to the sea-side, and with this view inquiries were set on foot for some quiet, out-of-the-way place, unfrequented by cockneys, yet not involving too long travel for the invalid. Such a place, rare in these days, being at last discovered on the south-western coast, thither Maggie, Nelly, Mr. Carew, and the child repaired early in August, the first part of the journey being accomplished by rail, the latter in a roomy travelling carriage.</p>

<p>It was dusk when the party reached Ashbourne, but already Maggie’s sensitive organisation was sensible of a pleasant and wholesome influence.</p>

<p>” I hear the long wash of the sea,” she said, ” on a pebbly beach, and the sound of the wind through the fir trees, and the odour of the two come blended to me delightfully ! They seem to bring me new life,” and she drew a long deep breath, and leaned back in the carriage with closed eyes, enjoying the healthful influence.</p>

<p>A charming cottage (belonging to a private family, who had let it to go abroad), backed by pine woods that sheltered it from the north, and standing at the top of a lawn that sloped down towards the sea, was the retreat that had been prepared for them.</p>

<p>Maggie retired to her room at once, and having taken some tea was soon in bed ; and as she did not wish to sleep yet, fearful of paying the penalty of a restless night for such indulgence, Nelly came and sat by her bedside.</p>

<p>” Oh what rest, what repose !” Maggie said, ” and the bed is so good, and such lavendery sheets ; and the room so nice ! I dote upon these cottage rooms, with this pretty old Indian chintz furniture and hangings. Those birds will be a study for me when I lie awake in the early mornings.
Put back the window curtain, Nelly dear, that I may have the first glimpse of the sea to-morrow.”</p>

<p>” You can have it to-night, my darling,” Nelly replied, as she obeyed —  “see !”</p>

<p>The moon, now at the full, was set in the profound blue-black firmament, and a broad line of rippled silver lay below, stretching away to the far horizon.</p>

<p>” Lovely, lovely old sea ! beautiful in all its moods !” Maggie said, ” but in few so beautiful as this. Do you know, I never see it with that line of moonlight on it that I don’t think of Christ’s walking on the waters, and fancying that to be the radiant path marked out by His footsteps. To-morrow I must go and sit on the beach for long hours, till I have my heart’s content of the sea, sight, sound, feel, and smell. How Norman will enjoy it ! At Boulogne it is such a sophisticated sea that it’s hardly like the true thing. No discoveries to be made there, and the low, plashy, wet sands, full of long lines of water, are horrid for children to run about on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Nelly replied, ” I hardly ever take him on the beach —for that reason, partly, but chiefly because of all the people there. I hate a frequented watering-place. No where else, I think, do idleness and frivolity flourish to the same extent, and nowhere do they seem to me so out of place. The great, wild, untameable, irreclaimable sea, the nearest approach we have to infinity, appears the element of all others calculated to inspire grave, solemn, solitary moods and thoughts. Earth we can make assume almost what aspect we will; fire burns as a first necessary on every peasant’s hearth, air is with us and about us, and <i>in</i> us, every breath we draw. The sea, alone, we can do nothing with ; it won’t be portioned and parcelled off for our everyday needs, nor shaped, nor trimmed, nor marked out with boundary lines. In its kindly moods it consents to carry our ships on its surface, but a moment’s anger and they are swallowed up alive and no account rendered of them, and no man can say where or how they have perished !”</p>

<p>” Yes,” Maggie said, but the response was in so very slumberous a tone that it at once brought Nelly back to dry land again.</p>

<p>” It’s no use, Maggie, battling with sleep ; it will have its way, or worse, maybe if you try too hard to repulse it, it will be affronted and take its departure altogether. At any rate it’s getting on to ten o’clock. Indeed, dear, think you’d better settle down for the night now, and here comes Everett to give me the turn out, <i>bon gré malgré.</i> Good night, bird; sleep well in the new nest; let me know the first thing in the morning that you’ve done so.”</p>

<p>Nelly went to bed, but not soon to sleep. A thousand thoughts were busy in her head, and she lay awake, half-conscious of the sounds around her; the regular breathing of Norman, in his little cot, the tapping of a spray of climbing roses against the window-pane, the full, solemn rush of the wind through the pines, and the</p>

<p>” Moan of an unknown sea.”</p>

<p>At last drowsiness began to steal over her and confuse her impressions ; now the sighing of the pines became human sighs, the tapping of the rose branch a signal, and just at that struggle that so often occurs when our waking faculties make an effort to distinguish between the real and ideal, a long, shrill, wailing scream made her start up wide awake, and sit trembling frgm head to foot, listening for a repetition or any explanation of the sound. But neither came, and thinking it must be only the cry of a seabird, she lay down again, and after some time fell into a disturbed sleep, which lasted till morning.</p>

<p>When she awoke and looked at her watch, she found it was little more than five o’clock ; but she felt so broadly and entirely awake that she knew, any further attempt to court sleep would be useless. Feeling too restless to lie still, she rose softly, not to disturb Norman, and drawing back the curtain and looking out of the window, she came suddenly, like one who has been led blindfold to some enchanted scene, on the unknown prospect spread out beneath. There it lay, a foreground of flowers, thickly set and glowing with colour; a lawn, dim with dew, save where here and there a diamond glistened with changing hues ; to the right a belt of pines, with a church spire rising behind them, on a background of blue mountain ; on the left a hill side, with scattered cottages, falling down to a narrow valley, with a stream pursuing its quiet way to the sea, at the bottom, and another hill, steep and precipitous, where sheep and goats were grazing and tinkling clear bells, rising to the high horizon ; in front the sea rippling so softly beneath the morning sun that it seemed to quiver with pleasure, and the regular plash of the tiny wavelets on the beach was hardly audible, while the white seamews, the white sails as they turned to or from the slanting sunbeams, became alternately gold and lead.</p>

<p>Nelly leant her tired head against the windowframe.</p>

<p>” Oh that I could ‘ take the wings of the morning, and fly to the uttermost parts of the sea !’ ” she said, inwardly ; ” surely there must be a place of rest somewhere, if one could but find it! And yet it is not quite rest alone that I crave; I am so young, life is so strong in me — I would fain have a little happiness, a little of life’s enjoyment — before I can be content with mere rest ! —</p>

<p>certainly cannot suffice me !”</p>

<p>As she thought thus, the child stirred in his cot, and brought back suddenly to herself — or, what was more to her than herself, to him — she stept softly to his side —</p>

<p>” He saw his mother’s face, accepting it
In change for heaven itself, with such a smile
As might have well been learnt there — never moved,
But smiled on, in a drowse of ecstasy,
So happy (half with her and half with heaven),
He could not have the trouble to be stirred,
But smiled and lay there.”</p>

<p>Then he stretched up his fat arms, clasped them round her neck, and drawing her face down on his pillow, held her there, till some of the glow of his cheek passed into her pale one, as they lay pressed together.</p>

<p>Ah, Nelly, have you no happiness on earth, no compensation?</p>

<p>It was strange, but passionately as she loved the child, her love never took the form of thankfulness. She accepted the gift as a matter of course ; if ever, in any of his childish maladies, the possibility of losing him struck across her mind, her thought was, ” Ay, it wants but <i>that</i> to complete the curse that lies on me !” but when the danger was past, again she reclaimed the precious life as a thing of right, and for which she stood in naught indebted.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, Everett tapped at her door, and announced that Maggie had had an excellent night, and felt better this morning than she had done since her illness.</p>

<p>Nelly hastened to dress, and went to her. Her early morning toilette was already made, and the delicate little face, with its blue eyes and shining hair, whose sunny rings would struggle forth from the trimness of the plaited cap border, wore an aspect Nelly had not seen for long.</p>

<p>The usual greetings past, Nelly brought a a hand-glass to the bedside.</p>

<p>“You like pretty faces,” she said, holding it before Maggie’s. ” Now don’t let us have any false modesty or nonsense, but tell me what you call that !”</p>

<p>” I call it a little squeezed-up wizened fairy, an uncanny thing that it would frighten Lorry out of his seventeen senses to see you have anything to do with !” and Maggie laughed her ringing laugh ; but suddenly stopping, she said, with tender concern, ” but you, my beauty, you don’t look yourself at all this morning. Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p>” No, only I had a restless night, and was startled by the screaming of some seabird, I suppose. Did you hear it —just at half-past one o’clock? I was afraid it would disturb you.”</p>

<p>” No, I heard nothing ; I believe I slept like a dormouse all the night through. Now sit down, and let us make up the programme of the day’s entertainments.</p>
