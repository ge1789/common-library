<!-- chapter title "The Master of Ariscedwyn" -->
<p>The grounds of Ariscedwyn looked beautiful in the light of a summer's morning. So thought Mr. Ryder, as he paced thoughtfully up and down the broad gravelled terrace in front of the house, waiting a summons to the presence of its master. A house was the only term you could apply to that building; it was not sufficiently grand to be called a mansion, nor sufficiently antique to call itself a priory or a castle; it was simply a comfortable modern house, large enough for any required purposes, good enough to have belonged to any member of the aristocracy, with lofty, well lighted apartments, and containing all the modern charms of billiard-room, conservatory, and ball-room. Any one could see that it had not been built long, and, indeed, fifty years was the outside of its age; it had been erected by the present Mr. Treherne's father, when the walls of the old mansion had been pronounced no longer repairable, and likely to come down any day on the heads of his family. There were still some remains of the old place, said to have been built by one Jeffrey Treherne, more than five hundred years before, to commemorate the safe return from battle, and subsequent marriage of his only son, who afterwards went out of his mind, and killed himself by a leap from the roof of the very mansion his father had erected in gratitude for his preservation. A sad story, but, doubtless, with no more truth in it than most old women's tales. When we see how much moss a rolling stone can gather in a few days in our own time (what a stupid proverb it is that says it doesn't), we need not be surprised if, after the lapse of years, it is so coated over that none of the original stone is to be seen. The chapel which belonged to the old house was still standing intact, and was a very beautiful specimen of the architecture of the time it was built in; otherwise there was little that was not modern about Ariscedwyn, except the wood. As Mr. Ryder stayed his regular pacing up and down for a moment to gaze upon the scene before him, he could not help thinking what a strange destiny it was that had taken in a day the promise of all this wealth out of the hands of the man who had been reared to expect it, and given it to a young girl who was even yet in utter ignorance that it existed, and could scarcely be anticipated ever to become fit to hold it properly. From beneath the broad terrace which he stood on, sloped away a vast lawn, so large and smooth, and finely kept, it looked like a sheet of green velvet laid down for royalty to step on. No beds of flowers were permitted to cut up and spoil its smooth extent; from end to end it was level, unbroken, and verdant. Where it ended, a light, invisible fence marked the boundary of the park, which had been the pride of the Trehernes for centuries past. No trees were ever permitted to be felled there to satisfy hungry creditors; not an acre of Ariscedwyn had ever been mortgaged. The Trehernes had numberless faults, but they had always been respectable, and that worst description of "wild oats," robbing tradesmen of their own, had not been amongst the category of their crimes, consequently the park of Ariscedwyn had flourished in peace. Amongst its ancient trees were many of the finest specimens our country can produce. Under their shade, herds of fallow deer lay down to rest amidst the cool ferns, whilst white boards nailed up here and there against the trees, with the word "dangerous" painted on them in black letters, marked the approach to the haunts of the drove of red deer, and were as studiously avoided by all females as if they led to the den of the old gentleman himself. The morning as yet was not sufficiently advanced to prove unpleasantly hot, but when it was so, what cover from heat that park afforded, with its banks of ferns and wild flowers, and its various dells so shut in from the sun's rays that the ground was always dark and damp, and the grass grew short and greyish green! A very pleasant place to lie at full length in, with a volume of Tennyson or Longfellow in your hand, on a full-grown August day, and think how all the world outside is broiling, whilst you are half lulled to sleep by the soft rustling of the boughs overhead, and the drowsy hum of bees amongst the foxgloves, linked to the memory of dreamy, musical poetry; but not so nice on a winter's day, when the inner man is sufficiently chilled already, and shudders at the very thought of grassless banks and dripping branches. Well, nothing can be delightful at all times, even love palls when you are hungry and want your dinner, and there were other charms at Ariscedwyn to turn to when the park failed to be charming. You must not suppose because flowers were banished from the lawn, that they were banished altogether; for there was the rose garden on the south side of the house, and the general garden at the back, with its wealth of hothouses and conservatories, and the kitchen gardens beyond that, a mass of fruit, both in and out of season, and forcing frames and hot-beds, and pineries, and grape-houses; and on the fourth side of the house a fine mass of flowering shrubs, round which the carriage-drive swept, and to which were adjacent, stables, and coach-houses, and all the outbuildings necessary to the comfort of a large establishment—adjacent yet unseen, by the judicious arrangement of walls and shrubberies. And then the broad drive led off to the iron gates, which opened upon the highway, and was kept throughout its course as the approach to a gentleman's house should be; and around and beyond all this mass of comfort and luxury, lay acres and acres of arable land, either let out to agriculturists, or turned to use for the Ariscedwyn stables, all belonging to the same noble property. Surely, it was not a place to be relinquished without many a sigh. So thought Mr. Ryder, as he looked down upon it from the terrace. He had come down the night before, after having left Mdlle. du Broissart with the lady at Blackheath, to whom he had been commissioned to give her in charge, but he had arrived too late to see Mr. Treherne, who had suffered in his health from the late events which had crowded so thickly upon him. A hasty letter from Dover had informed him that the heiress to his estate was found, and Mr. Ryder had come down to give him the particulars of their journey and subsequent actions with respect to his grand-daughter. As he stood, thinking and gazing, a servant advanced from the doors of the breakfast room, which opened on to the terrace, to inform him that Mr. Treherne was ready to see him. Not in the breakfast-room, however, but in his own dressing-room, where he usually had his breakfast . Mr. Ryder thought he saw a difference in him already, as the old man rose in his dressing-gown to receive him as he entered the room. His face looked careworn and harassed, and had lost the look of content it had now for many years past possessed. As he wished Mr. Ryder "good morning," he apologized for not having met him at the breakfast-table.</p>
<p>"I'm getting very old, Ryder," he said, "and begin to feel very disinclined to early rising." And then, as if to commence the subject was a great effort, and he felt he had better plunge into it at once, he added: "You did not tell me much in your letter, Ryder, about my--my grand-daughter; of course we can't expect to make it a pleasant subject, but I must hear all about it, so the sooner the better."</p>
<p>"I had not time, sir, in my hurried note to give you any particulars respecting Mdlle. du Broissart, nor had I seen sufficient of her then to be justified in passing an opinion; I had better opportunities of observation during our journey to London together.</p>
<p>"What is she like, Ryder?"</p>
<p>"She is very handsome, sir, something like Mr. William Treherne, it struck me; a fair, rosy-complexion, with dark hair and eyes."</p>
<p>"Ah! the Treherne face, regularly Welsh, eh, Ryder?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir, I should say, not quite; she bears a mixture of foreign blood in her features."</p>
<p>"But what kind of a girl did she seem, Ryder? I know she must be uneducated, and so forth, but did you see no traits of her character? did she appear modest and affectionate, and so forth."</p>
<p>Mr. Ryder thought of the kisses and the half-crowns, and the utter indifference displayed on Mdlle. du Broissart's part when she bade farewell to those who had cared for her from infancy, and felt silence was his only resource.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Treherne, I should feel myself scarcely justified if I even attempted to answer such a question to you; you forget I only saw the young lady altogether for a few hours, and then not under the most favourable circumstances. When I left her under Miss Plimpton's charge, she appeared very shy, but that was natural.</p>
<p>"Ah, well!" said the old man, "shyness is a good quality in a young woman, and not too often cultivated amongst the lower orders. That is what I most fear, Ryder; the moral feelings she may have imbibed from the class she has associated with, want of education would be a trifle compared to it."</p>
<p>"The woman who has had the charge of her--Mrs. Willis--seemed a very respectable person," said Mr. Ryder, "and exceedingly fond of Mdlle. du Broissart."</p>
<p>"I think Miss Plimpton will do all she can for her," added Mr. Treherne, as if he had not heard Mr. Ryder's last remark. "I wrote and told her all the circumstances, and she promised she would. It is not everybody that would undertake such a charge, but old Mrs. Plimpton was governess to my late wife, and they are indebted to her family in some measure for their present position. Not that I would have taken advantage of such a fact, but some one must do it for me. It will be a heavy responsibility."</p>
<p>"I suppose you will run up to Blackheath and see Mdlle. du Broissart yourself, sir, before long; will you not?" demanded Mr. Ryder.</p>
<p>"Yes, Ryder; yes, after a little. I don't feel equal to the journey just at present, and would rather delay it. It cannot be expected I should look forward to it as a pleasure--my poor George!"</p>
<p>Mr. Ryder also thought it might be advisable the introduction was delayed till Mademoiselle du Broissart had been a little drilled by Miss Plimpton, and so offered no objection to the proposal of his client. The old man sat for some time silent, and as in deep thought, and then he said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Ryder, I have been thinking very much, as you may suppose, ever since I knew there was a probability of this girl being found, about Ariscedwyn passing away from George Treherne. It is breaking my heart, Ryder; it is, indeed!"</p>
<p>"You shouldn't think of it so much as that, sir," was the lawyer's reply. "Mr. George Treherne does not, I am sure."</p>
<p>"I don't know that, Ryder; the boy is not one to show his feelings easily. I'm sure he was very much cut up when he heard it, though he said little enough about it. But as for me, I think of it night and day. The place must be his, Ryder; it would be pure injustice to take it from him; but there is only one way he can have it now, and that is by marrying this girl. That is what has made me so anxious, Ryder, to see you. Tell me, is there any chance that she will ever be fit to be his wife?"</p>
<p>Mr. Ryder almost shuddered as he thought what a lucky beggar the husband of Hélène du Broissart would probably prove, but it was not his business to say so.</p>
<p>"My dear sir," he commenced, "education will doubtless do wonders for Mademoiselle du Broissart; and as for her personal appearance, she only requires dress to make that all it should be for a Treherne."</p>
<p>"How soon do you think I shall be able to have her home, Ryder?"</p>
<p>"I am scarcely a judge in such matters, sir. Miss Plimpton would be a better referee; but a few years, I should think, would be necessary to elapse, before such an event. A few years are nothing for education, when everything has to be begun."</p>
<p>"A few years!" exclaimed Mr. Treherne. "I couldn't wait till then, the suspense would kill me. Why, George might marry in the interim!"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mention the subject to Mr. George though, sir, if I may presume to offer you my advice, until Mademoiselle du Broissart is fit to become his wife, else you may mar your own wishes. Young men are apt to run rusty, if such delicate matters as the choice of a wife are suggested to them, instead of being left to their own inclinations."</p>
<p>"I don't think George would refuse me, if I asked him," said Mr. Treherne.</p>
<p>"But I wouldn't ask him, sir; at least, not yet, if I were you," rejoined the lawyer, decidedly.</p>
<p>But his good advice was thrown away upon Mr. Treherne. He thought over the project of the marriage both night and day, till he longed to receive an assurance from his nephew that he would try and not oppose his wishes in the matter, until one morning, not many after his conversation with Mr. Ryder, when he had just received rather a satisfactory letter from Miss Plimpton, written in a very hopeful strain, as regarded her new pupil, and the lawyer had gone back to his chambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and taken his friendly counsel with him, Mr. Treherne sat down to his writing-table, and the following letter was carried in the Ariscedwyn bag to the next post town the same afternoon.</p>
<p>"Ariscedwyn, August 18—.</p>
<p>"My Dear George,—I wish you would get three days' leave and come down to Ariscedwyn. I have not been well since my journey to Paris, and I miss you sadly. William will have told you all about the finding of Mademoiselle du Broissart, and my subsequent actions with regard to her. I have this morning received a letter from Miss Plimpton, the lady under whose charge she has been placed, written in a very hopeful strain, as to the probabilities of her being able to take her proper place here at no lengthened period. From this, I opine she has natural ability, a gift I have often heard you say you admire most in women. I shall not write more, as I have much to say to you which will not go in a letter. Hoping to see you soon, I remain,</p>
<p>"Your affectionate uncle,</p>
<p>"G. Tbeherne."</p>
<p>George Treherne was in barracks when he received this letter, employed in the operation of dressing; he had been going through it moodily enough, his thoughts occupied with the loss he had sustained, though he would scarcely have acknowledged it. This letter did not tend to make him more lively. He thought his uncle had taken up the granddaughter's cause very quietly, and looked forward to her taking her proper place at Ariscedwyn as the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>"What is it to me," he said, angrily, to himself, "whether the girl has natural ability or not? it has been directed too long to the occupation of shrimping, I should imagine, to be fit for much else. I don't want to go down to Ariscedwyn, and I shan't go."</p>
<p>But his better feelings gained the victory over this little outburst of pettishness, for he really cared for his uncle, and knew well enough that he was cared for in return; so he procured his three days' leave, and as soon as it was obtained, started for Wales.</p>
