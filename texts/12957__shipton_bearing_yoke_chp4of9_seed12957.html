<p>Harry took his father’s death very quietly, after the fashion of English lads and young men. He could not cry out, or lament, or even talk about what he felt; and he was not one of those to whom tears come easily. He did what had to be done, and helped his mother to make all necessary arrangements, and stood by his father’s grave with a set face and dry eyes. But still waters run deep, and perhaps he was thinking and feeling all the more because his thoughts and feelings made so little outward show.</p>
<p>The people of these upland regions have a decent and comely habit of burying their dead out of their sight as quickly as possible. Perhaps they feel that the quiet churchyard is a fitter place for them than their own small crowded houses, and so make haste to lay them where the noise and stir of the rough bustling world can never come near them more.</p>
<p>So two days after James Newbold’s death the black train came slowly out from the little farm yard gate; and he who had passed it last in his rough toil-worn clothes, going about his daily work, was borne out solemnly, almost in state his working days over for ever.</p>
<p>It was all over and done, and as Harry lingered behind the rest of the funeral train, watching the grave filled in and the sod laid smoothly over, he knew that he had buried his boyhood there in his father’s grave, that hence forward he must be a man, with more than most men’s burden of thought and care.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done was to consider what was to become of them all — how they were to live now the master and bread-winner was gone. Happily there was little doubt that they would be allowed to keep on the farm.</p>
<p>The duke’s agent was a kind-hearted gentleman, and it was so much the custom for these small hill-farms to go down from father to son, that it was most probable that he would overlook Harry’s youth, and allow him to try to make a living for himself and his family, as his father had done before him.</p>
<p>Harry went down to the pretty little town in the valley behind Burley Edge, where Mr. Bloomfield the agent lived. But he was out, so matters were left to stand on till the Lady-day rents should be paid.</p>
<p>The long cold spring days grew longer and longer, and slowly and as it were unwillingly the warmth came back to the wild bare hills. The heather budded into a lighter green, the young fronds of bracken put up their tender fingers between the clumps of furze and the great grey stones, and the larks filled all the air with a positive tumult of rejoicing.</p>
<p>And life went on much as usual at the little farm on Burley Edge, except that Harry went about his work alone; and for awhile there was no laughing or singing indoors or out, and even the voices of the twins were hushed and grave.</p>
<p>There had naturally been a good deal of expense at the time of the funeral, and Harry had hardly noticed it, nor would he have objected if he had. It would have seemed to him a kind of disrespect to his father to be saving then. And for a time afterwards the little household had no heart to launch out into any small ex travagances, and cared little enough what they ate or what they wore.</p>
<p>But little by little they came back to more ordinary modes of thought and feeling, and then Harry began to consider seriously his future line of conduct. He saw clearly that if he were to keep his word to his father it would not be done without much hard work and patience and economy.</p>
<p>The little farm could not be worked so profitably as before, for there was much that Harry could not do alone, and hired labour was a serious expense. A living they might somehow manage to make, but to save money would be a difficult matter indeed.</p>
<p>“And mother isn’t fond of saving,” he thought to himself. “She didn’t take to it kindly when father wanted her to do it, and however will she take it if <i>I</i> ask her?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, the second week in May came on, and Mr. Bloomfield would be coming to the Peacock at Bridge End to receive the duke’s rents.</p>
<p>The rent of the farm at Burley Edge was not a very serious matter, but Harry felt a little nervous as he put on his Sunday clothes to take the money down to Bridge End. Suppose Mr. Bloomfield should “turn stupid,” as they say in those parts, and refuse to let him keep on the farm?</p>
<p>He went down the village street, at the end of which the Peacock swung upon a sign-board and displayed the glories of his tail. But he turned aside before he reached the inn, and opened the churchyard gate, and stepped softly to where his father’s grave was growing green under the spring showers and sunshine. He stood still for a moment beside it. “Father!” he said within himself, “I’ll keep my word, however things go. I’ll not forget.”</p>
<p>When he reached the inn door, it stood open, and there was the little crowd that he remembered so well when he used to come as a little fellow with his father — the same old faces, only grown a trifle older and greyer.</p>
<p>Behind a table in the large bar-parlour sat Mr. Bloomfield, an elderly man, with white whiskers, and a fierce and yet kindly-looking face. He was a good sportsman and a gallant gentleman, and the people liked him well, though they trembled before his sharp tongue, and thought him at least as great a man as the duke.</p> <p>An elderly woman was standing before him, with her eyes demurely cast down. She was commonly known as Kitty Turnbull, and Harry knew her well enough, for she and her daughter and son-in-law had a house and a bit of land between Burley Edge and Bridge End, and lived upon it in a queer shiftless fashion. She was one of three sisters, all of whom were supposed to be a little mad — but which was the maddest no one had ever been able to discover.</p>
<p>Behind Mr. Bloomfield sat Mr. Fielding, and they both seemed to be intensely amused; in fact Mr. Bloomfield had just burst into a perfect roar of laughter.</p>
<p>“Why, woman!” he exclaimed, recovering himself, “don’t you know that you’re only a yearly tenant?”</p>
<p>“To be sure, sir,” she said, bobbing a peculiar little curtsy.</p>
<p>“And you’ve let James Newham have those two crofts from you at a seven years’ lease! There, get along with you, and don’t let me hear any more about it, or I shall have to send you both packing.”</p>
<p>Kitty Turnbull drew up her tall angular figure, and pursed up her lips, as if she were far from seeing what she had done amiss. But she drew back, and let Harry Newbold come forward in his turn.</p>
<p>The agent’s keen kindly eyes softened as they fell upon the lad’s grave shy face.</p>
<p>“Well, my lad,” he said, “they tell me you’ve had trouble at your place, and I’m sorry to see you here instead of your father. He was a good, honest, God-fearing man, and we shall all miss him. And what are you thinking of doing now, you and your mother?”</p>
<p>“We mean to keep on the farm, sir, if you’ll allow of it. We think we can manage, and I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>“I believe you will,” answered Mr. Bloomfield, looking on Harry’s tall strong figure and resolute features with approving eyes. “But you’re young, you see, and you want experience as well as pluck to make it do. What do you think, vicar? Shan’t I be doing wrong to let them have the farm, as things are?”</p>
<p>Mr. Fielding smiled. “I think you might do worse,” he said. “And I think that you intend to let them have it, and that Harry must do his best, that you may never have cause to repent of it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, if the parson’s on their side!” said the agent, beginning to write in a great hurry. “We’ll see how you get on, young man; but mind, no seven years’ leases for you.” And he laughed again.</p>
<p>Harry was a little puzzled, but he was glad enough to get his business settled and withdraw; thankful to be able to tell his mother that for the present at least their old home was not to be taken from them.</p> <p>Climbing the long hill that led upwards from Bridge End, he overtook old Kitty, wrapped in a thing very like a horse-cloth, in spite of the warm May day, and striding along like a man. She greeted him in a loud rough voice, very different to that in which she had spoken before the vicar and the agent, and had a greal deal to say.</p>
<p>She poured into his ears all the ins and outs of the piece of business that had so amused Mr. Bloomfield, making a very long story of it, and speaking in a dialect of which no southerner would have understood a single sentence.</p>
<p>Harry understood her well enough, though he did not talk quite so broadly himself. But he did not care enough about her to pay much heed to what she said, until at last she began to talk about her grandson Jack Bradford. Kitty’s only daughter had been very early married, and this lad, her eldest child, was about the age of Harry Newbold. They were a large family, all living together — grandmother, father and mother, and half a dozen or more of children, all careless, dirty, untidy, and accused of being dishonest. When Harry first came sufficiently out of the depths of his own thoughts to attend to what Kitty Turnbull was saying, she was bemoaning the undutifulness of her eldest grandson, who, it appeared, would not allow her to beat him now that he was old enough to defend himself. But from that she went on to lament his being so often out of work, and to propose that, since they were pretty near neighbours, Harry should give him a regular engagement to do irregular work up at Burley Edge — that is to say, to come up there whenever he had no more profitable employment.</p>
<p>Harry felt not a little indignant. A certain pleasant sense of ownership was beginning to soften the dreariness of going alone about the fields that had known his father so well. And it seemed to him a most unreasonable and unlikely thing that he should admit one of “them Bradfords” — a careless idle scamp like Jack — to work upon “<i>his</i> place!”</p>
<p>He might have told old Kitty so with considerable plainness, but at that moment they reached the gate by the roadside that led down to her small cottage of brownish-grey stone.</p>
<p>“Well! I mun be getting on home,” she said, turning towards the gate. “It’s late, and I want my drinking. But I’ll tell Jack to step up to t’Edge when he’s in wants of a day’s work, and I’m sure you’ll be fain to have him.”</p>
<p>She raised her voice almost to a shout as she went through the gate and down the path; but Harry went on without answering. “I’ll do nothing of the kind,” he said to himself. “If I’m to get on, it’ll not be with having aught to do with that lot.”</p>
<p>And then his thoughts went back to the former question. How was he to persuade his mother to be as careful and saving as they ought to be, if they were to have any hope of restoring his little cousins’ fortune? What chance was there that she would be willing to deny herself and the children every unnecessary indulgence, and scrape and save as they must do to lay by any sum worth mentioning?</p>
<p>It was not the first time that he had thought over this matter, but this time his thoughts bore fruit in a resolution that proved him to have a clearer head than his poor father had had. “I will tell my mother all about it,” he said to himself. “She has a right to know — and she’s not like some, that can’t hold their tongues. She’ll never tell a soul, and when she knows that there’s a reason for it she’ll be as ready to save and be careful as any one. It’s the only way, and I’m sure father would think it right, if he knew.”</p>
<p>It was not without a struggle that he came to this resolution, for there seemed to be something better and more complete in keeping his pledge to his father absolutely inviolate, and not breaking the secret to <i>any one.</i> But he had sense enough to see what could and what could not be done, and he fell back upon his belief that if he could only explain matters to his father he too would approve.</p>
<p>So that night, after the little girls and Rosa were gone to bed, Harry lingered over the fire, trying to find courage to begin, till his mother exclaimed at him for a dawdling lad, and told him that he would not be ready for his work in the morning. Then he left off considering how to begin, and plunged at once into the middle of his story, and told her all. She was a good deal startled and surprised, but she was an easy-tempered cheery woman, to whom no shock could be very overwhelming. She did not take much to heart the injustice she had so often done her husband by complaining of his <i>nearness</i> and mean ways; perhaps because it was so long now since she had thought of him with anything but love and tenderness. But she was quite as much alive as Harry could be to the importance of saving his good name, and restoring to the little girls their lost fortune. Nay! she went further than her son, and half believed that the law might have power to send them all to prison together if the money were not forthcoming when Jenny and Annie came of age.</p>
<p>She slept upon the startling intelligence, and came down the next day full of sweeping plans for saving and making money. And first of all she insisted on sending Rosa also to service. She could manage the work by herself, she said, and there would be the girl’s keep saved. This was not at all what Harry wished, but he was obliged to own that it would be best. So Rosa was sent out to do for herself as Mary had been before her, and the little house seemed strangely empty with only Harry and his mother and the two little girls.</p>
<p>Mrs. Newbold could not be always economical — it was not her nature. But she felt it now to be her duty, though an uncongenial one, and she and her son both pulled one way in the matter.</p>
<p>One thing rather puzzled Harry. Where had his father put that sum of money, nearly one hundred pounds, which he had said he had saved? He looked in every place, likely and unlikely, that he could think of, and his mother looked likewise, but they found nothing. There were not many hiding-places about the farm, and at last they were obliged to give it up and trust that chance might bring it to light some day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile time went on, and summer brought extra work with it, and old Kitty Turnbull’s words came true. Harry was “fain” to take Jack Bradford on to work with him, in spite of his prejudice against the family.</p>
<p>In that thinly populated neighbourhood helpers were not easily to be found, especially for one who was not prepared to give the highest of wages, and in a press of work the young farmer was glad to take any one whom he could get.</p>
<p>And Jack Bradford was not idle, though he was careless, irregular, and not over-steady. His brown good-looking face and tall lissom figure was soon a familiar sight enough at Burley Edge, and by dint of long working together Harry’s prejudice against him settled down into an unwilling half-suspicious friendliness.</p>
