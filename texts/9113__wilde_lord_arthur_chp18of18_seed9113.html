<!-- CHAPTER III -->
<p>After three weeks had elapsed, I
determined to make a strong appeal to Erskine to do justice to
the memory of Cyril Graham, and to give to the world his
marvellous interpretation of the Sonnets—the only
interpretation that thoroughly explained the problem. I have not any copy of my letter, I regret to say, nor have I been
able to lay my hand upon the original; but I remember that I went
over the whole ground, and covered sheets of paper with
passionate reiteration of the arguments and proofs that my study
had suggested to me. It seemed to me that I was not merely
restoring Cyril Graham to his proper place in literary history,
but rescuing the honour of Shakespeare himself from the tedious
memory of a commonplace intrigue. I put into the letter all
my enthusiasm. I put into the letter all my faith.</p>
    
<p>No sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction
came over me. It seemed to me that I had given away my
capacity for belief in the Willie Hughes theory of the Sonnets,
that something had gone out of me, as it were, and that I was
perfectly indifferent to the whole subject. What was it
that had happened? It is difficult to say. Perhaps,
by finding perfect expression for a passion, I had exhausted the
passion itself. Emotional forces, like the forces of
physical life, have their positive limitations. Perhaps the
mere effort to convert any one to a theory involves some form of
renunciation of the power of credence. Perhaps I was simply
tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having burnt out, my
reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment. However
it came about, and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no
doubt that Willie Hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth, an
idle dream, the boyish fancy of a young man who, like most ardent
spirits, was more anxious to convince others than to be himself
convinced.</p>
    
<p>As I had said some very unjust and bitter things to Erskine in
my letter, I determined to go and see him at once, and to make my
apologies to him for my behaviour. Accordingly, the next
morning I drove down to Birdcage Walk, and found Erskine sitting
in his library, with the forged picture of Willie Hughes in front
of him.</p>
    
<p>‘My dear Erskine!’ I cried, ‘I have come to apologise to you.’</p>
    
<p>‘To apologise to me?’ he said. ‘What for?’</p>
    
<p>‘For my letter,’ I answered.</p>
    
<p>‘You have nothing to regret in your letter,’ he
said. ‘On the contrary, you have done me the greatest
service in your power. You have shown me that Cyril
Graham’s theory is perfectly sound.’</p>
    
<p>‘You don’t mean to say that you believe in Willie
Hughes?’ I exclaimed.</p>
    
<p>‘Why not?’ he rejoined. ‘You have proved the thing to me. Do you think I cannot estimate the
value of evidence?’</p>
    
<p>‘But there is no evidence at all,’ I groaned,
sinking into a chair. ‘When I wrote to you I was
under the influence of a perfectly silly enthusiasm. I had
been touched by the story of Cyril Graham’s death,
fascinated by his romantic theory, enthralled by the wonder and
novelty of the whole idea. I see now that the theory is
based on a delusion. The only evidence for the existence of
Willie Hughes is that picture in front of you, and the picture is
a forgery. Don’t be carried away by mere sentiment in
this matter. Whatever romance may have to say about the
Willie Hughes theory, reason is dead against it.’</p>
    
<p>‘I don’t understand you,’ said Erskine,
looking at me in amazement. ‘Why, you yourself have
convinced me by your letter that Willie Hughes is an absolute
reality. Why have you changed your mind? Or is all
that you have been saying to me merely a joke?’</p>
    
<p>‘I cannot explain it to you,’ I rejoined,
‘but I see now that there is really nothing to be said in
favour of Cyril Graham’s interpretation. The Sonnets
are addressed to Lord Pembroke. For heaven’s sake
don’t waste your time in a foolish attempt to discover a
young Elizabethan actor who never existed, and to make a phantom
puppet the centre of the great cycle of Shakespeare’s
Sonnets.’</p>
    
<p>‘I see that you don’t understand the theory,’ he replied.</p>
    
<p>‘My dear Erskine,’ I cried, ‘not understand
it! Why, I feel as if I had invented it. Surely my
letter shows you that I not merely went into the whole matter,
but that I contributed proofs of every kind. The one flaw
in the theory is that it presupposes the existence of the person
whose existence is the subject of dispute. If we grant that
there was in Shakespeare’s company a young actor of the
name of Willie Hughes, it is not difficult to make him the object
of the Sonnets. But as we know that there was no actor of
this name in the company of the Globe Theatre, it is idle to
pursue the investigation further.’</p> 
    
<p>‘But that is exactly what we don’t know,’
said Erskine. ‘It is quite true that his name does
not occur in the list given in the first folio; but, as Cyril
pointed out, that is rather a proof in favour of the existence of
Willie Hughes than against it, if we remember his treacherous
desertion of Shakespeare for a rival dramatist.’</p>
    
<p>We argued the matter over for hours, but nothing that I could
say could make Erskine surrender his faith in Cyril
Graham’s interpretation. He told me that he intended
to devote his life to proving the theory, and that he was
determined to do justice to Cyril Graham’s memory. I
entreated him, laughed at him, begged of him, but it was of no
use. Finally we parted, not exactly in anger, but certainly
with a shadow between us. He thought me shallow, I thought
him foolish. When I called on him again his servant told me
that he had gone to Germany.</p>
    
<p>Two years afterwards, as I was going into my club, the
hall-porter handed me a letter with a foreign postmark. It
was from Erskine, and written at the Hôtel
d’Angleterre, Cannes. When I had read it I was filled
with horror, though I did not quite believe that he would be so
mad as to carry his resolve into execution. The gist of the
letter was that he had tried in every way to verify the Willie
Hughes theory, and had failed, and that as Cyril Graham had given
his life for this theory, he himself had determined to give his
own life also to the same cause. The concluding words of
the letter were these: ‘I still believe in Willie Hughes;
and by the time you receive this, I shall have died by my own
hand for Willie Hughes’s sake: for his sake, and for the
sake of Cyril Graham, whom I drove to his death by my shallow
scepticism and ignorant lack of faith. The truth was once
revealed to you, and you rejected it. It comes to you now
stained with the blood of two lives,—do not turn away from
it.’</p>
    
<p>It was a horrible moment. I felt sick with misery, and
yet I could not believe it. To die for one’s
theological beliefs is the worst use a man can make of his life,
but to die for a literary theory! It seemed impossible.</p>
    
<p>I looked at the date. The letter was a week old.
Some unfortunate chance had prevented my going to the club for
several days, or I might have got it in time to save him.
Perhaps it was not too late. I drove off to my rooms,
packed up my things, and started by the night-mail from Charing
Cross. The journey was intolerable. I thought I would
never arrive. As soon as I did I drove to the Hôtel
l’Angleterre. They told me that Erskine had been
buried two days before in the English cemetery. There was
something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy. I
said all kinds of wild things, and the people in the hall looked
curiously at me.</p>
    
<p>Suddenly Lady Erskine, in deep mourning, passed across the
vestibule. When she saw me she came up to me, murmured
something about her poor son, and burst into tears. I led
her into her sitting-room. An elderly gentleman was there
waiting for her. It was the English doctor.</p>
    
<p>We talked a great deal about Erskine, but I said nothing about
his motive for committing suicide. It was evident that he
had not told his mother anything about the reason that had driven
him to so fatal, so mad an act. Finally Lady Erskine rose
and said, George left you something as a memento. It was a
thing he prized very much. I will get it for you.</p>
    
<p>As soon as she had left the room I turned to the doctor and
said, ‘What a dreadful shock it must have been to Lady
Erskine! I wonder that she bears it as well as she
does.’</p>
    
<p>‘Oh, she knew for months past that it was coming,’ he answered.</p>
    
<p>‘Knew it for months past!’ I cried.
‘But why didn’t she stop him? Why didn’t
she have him watched? He must have been mad.’</p>
    
<p>The doctor stared at me. ‘I don’t know what you
mean,’ he said.</p>
    
<p>‘Well,’ I cried, ‘if a mother knows that her
son is going to commit suicide—’</p>
    
<p>‘Suicide!’ he answered. ‘Poor Erskine
did not commit suicide. He died of consumption. He
came here to die. The moment I saw him I knew that there
was no hope. One lung was almost gone, and the other was
very much affected. Three days before he died he asked me
was there any hope. I told him frankly that there was none,
and that he had only a few days to live. He wrote some
letters, and was quite resigned, retaining his senses to the
last.’</p>
    
<p>At that moment Lady Erskine entered the room with the fatal
picture of Willie Hughes in her hand. ‘When George
was dying he begged me to give you this,’ she said.
As I took it from her, her tears fell on my hand.</p>
    
<p>The picture hangs now in my library, where it is very much
admired by my artistic friends. They have decided that it
is not a Clouet, but an Oudry. I have never cared to tell
them its true history. But sometimes, when I look at it, I
think that there is really a great deal to be said for the Willie
Hughes theory of Shakespeare’s Sonnets.</p>
