<!-- chapter title is '"I Had Better Go Away"' -->
<p>When Lord Fawn gave a sudden jump and stalked away towards the house
on that Sunday morning before breakfast, Lucy Morris was a very
unhappy girl. She had a second time accused Lord Fawn of speaking an
untruth. She did not quite understand the usages of the world in the
matter; but she did know that the one offence which a gentleman is
supposed never to commit is that of speaking an untruth. The offence
may be one committed oftener than any other by gentlemen,—as also by
all other people; but, nevertheless, it is regarded by the usages of
society as being the one thing which a gentleman never does. Of all
this Lucy understood something. The word “lie” she knew to be utterly
abominable. That Lizzie Eustace was a little liar had been
acknowledged between herself and the Fawn girls very often,—but to
have told Lady Eustace that any word spoken by her was a lie, would
have been a worse crime than the lie itself. To have brought such an
accusation, in that term, against Lord Fawn, would have been to
degrade herself for ever. Was there any difference between a lie and
an untruth? That one must be, and that the other need not be,
intentional, she did feel; but she felt also that the less offensive
word had come to mean a lie,—the world having been driven so to use
it because the world did not dare to talk about lies; and this word,
bearing such a meaning in common parlance, she had twice applied to
Lord Fawn. And yet, as she was well aware, Lord Fawn had told no lie.
He had himself believed every word that he had spoken against Frank
Greystock. That he had been guilty of unmanly cruelty in so speaking
of her lover in her presence, Lucy still thought, but she should not
therefore have accused him of falsehood. “It was untrue all the
same,” she said to herself, as she stood still on the gravel walk,
watching the rapid disappearance of Lord Fawn, and endeavouring to
think what she had better now do with herself. Of course Lord Fawn,
like a great child, would at once go and tell his mother what that
wicked governess had said to him.</p>

<p>In the hall she met her friend Lydia. “Oh, Lucy, what is the matter
with Frederic?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Lord Fawn is very angry indeed.”</p>

<p>“With you?”</p>

<p>“Yes;—with me. He is so angry that I am sure he would not sit down
to breakfast with me. So I won’t come down. Will you tell your mamma?
If she likes to send to me, of course I’ll go to her at once.”</p>

<p>“What have you done, Lucy?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told him again that what he said wasn’t true.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because—Oh, how can I say why? Why does any person do everything
that she ought not to do? It’s the fall of Adam, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t make a joke of it, Lucy.”</p>

<p>“You can have no conception how unhappy I am about it. Of course Lady
Fawn will tell me to go away. I went out on purpose to beg his pardon
for what I said last night, and I just said the very same thing
again.”</p>

<p>“But why did you say it?”</p>

<p>“And I should say it again and again and again, if he were to go on
telling me that Mr. Greystock isn’t a gentleman. I don’t think he
ought to have done it. Of course, I have been very wrong; I know
that. But I think he has been wrong too. But I must own it, and he
needn’t. I’ll go up now and stay in my own room till your mamma sends
for me.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll get Jane to bring you some breakfast.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a bit about breakfast,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>Lord Fawn did tell his mother, and Lady Fawn was perplexed in the
extreme. She was divided in her judgment and feelings between the
privilege due to Lucy as a girl possessed of an authorised lover,—a
privilege which no doubt existed, but which was not extensive,—and
the very much greater privilege which attached to Lord Fawn as a man,
as a peer, as an Under-Secretary of State,—but which attached to him
especially as the head and only man belonging to the Fawn family.
Such a one, when, moved by filial duty, he condescends to come once a
week to his mother’s house, is entitled to say whatever he pleases,
and should on no account be contradicted by any one. Lucy no doubt
had a lover,—an authorised lover; but perhaps that fact could not be
taken as more than a balancing weight against the inferiority of her
position as a governess. Lady Fawn was of course obliged to take her
son’s part, and would scold Lucy. Lucy must be scolded very
seriously. But it would be a thing so desirable if Lucy could be
induced to accept her scolding and have done with it, and not to make
matters worse by talking of going away! “You don’t mean that she came
out into the shrubbery, having made up her mind to be rude to you?”
said Lady Fawn to her son.</p>

<p>“No;—I do not think that. But her temper is so ungovernable, and she
has, if I may say so, been so spoilt among you here,—I mean by the
girls, of course,—that she does not know how to restrain herself.”</p>

<p>“She is as good as gold, you know, Frederic.” He shrugged his
shoulders, and declared that he had not a word more to say about it.
He could, of course, remain in London till it should suit Mr.
Greystock to take his bride. “You’ll break my heart if you say that!”
exclaimed the unhappy mother. “Of course, she shall leave the house
if you wish it.”</p>

<p>“I wish nothing,” said Lord Fawn. “But I peculiarly object to be told
that I am a—liar.” Then he stalked away along the corridor and went
down to breakfast, as black as a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>Lady Fawn and Lucy sat opposite to each other in church, but they did
not speak till the afternoon. Lady Fawn went to church in the
carriage and Lucy walked, and as Lucy retired to her room immediately
on her return to the house, there had not been an opportunity even
for a word. After lunch Amelia came up to her, and sat down for a
long discussion. “Now, Lucy, something must be done, you know,” said
Amelia.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Of course, mamma must see you. She can’t allow things to go on in
this way. Mamma is very unhappy, and didn’t eat a morsel of
breakfast.” By this latter assertion Amelia simply intended to imply
that her mother had refused to be helped a second time to fried
bacon, as was customary.</p>

<p>“Of course, I shall go to her the moment she sends for me. Oh,—I am
so unhappy!”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at that, Lucy. So is my brother unhappy. These things
make people unhappy. It is what the world calls—temper, you know,
Lucy.”</p>

<p>“Why did he tell me that Mr. Greystock isn’t a gentleman? Mr.
Greystock is a gentleman. I meant to say nothing more than that.”</p>

<p>“But you did say more, Lucy.”</p>

<p>“When he said that Mr. Greystock wasn’t a gentleman, I told him it
wasn’t true. Why did he say it? He knows all about it. Everybody
knows. Would you think it wise to come and abuse him to me, when you
know what he is to me? I can’t bear it, and I won’t. I’ll go away
to-morrow, if your mamma wishes it.” But that going away was just
what Lady Fawn did not wish.</p>

<p>“I think you know, Lucy, you should express your deep sorrow at what
has passed.”</p>

<p>“To your brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then he would abuse Mr. Greystock again, and it would all be as bad
as ever. I’ll beg Lord Fawn’s pardon if he’ll promise beforehand not
to say a word about Mr. Greystock.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect him to make a bargain like that, Lucy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. I daresay I’m very wicked, and I must be left wicked.
I’m too wicked to stay here. That’s the long and the short of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re proud, Lucy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am. If it wasn’t for all that I owe to everybody here,
and that I love you all so much, I should be proud of being
proud;—because of Mr. Greystock. Only it kills me to make Lady Fawn
unhappy.”</p>

<p>Amelia left the culprit, feeling that no good had been done, and Lady
Fawn did not see the delinquent till late in the afternoon. Lord Fawn
had, in the meantime, wandered out along the river all alone to brood
over the condition of his affairs. It had been an evil day for him in
which he had first seen Lady Eustace. From the first moment of his
engagement to her he had been an unhappy man. Her treatment of him,
the stories which reached his ears from Mrs. Hittaway and others, Mr.
Camperdown’s threats of law in regard to the diamonds, and Frank
Greystock’s insults, altogether made him aware that he could not
possibly marry Lady Eustace. But yet he had no proper and becoming
way of escaping from the bonds of his engagement. He was a man with a
conscience, and was made miserable by the idea of behaving badly to a
woman. Perhaps it might have been difficult to analyse his misery,
and to decide how much arose from the feeling that he was behaving
badly, and how much from the conviction that the world would accuse
him of doing so; but, between the two, he was wretched enough. The
punishment of the offence had been commenced by Greystock’s unavenged
insults;—and it now seemed to him that this girl’s conduct was a
continuation of it. The world was already beginning to treat him with
that want of respect which he so greatly dreaded. He knew that he was
too weak to stand up against a widely-spread expression of opinion
that he had behaved badly. There are men who can walk about the
streets with composed countenances, take their seats in Parliament if
they happen to have seats, work in their offices, or their chambers,
or their counting-houses with diligence, and go about the world
serenely, even though everybody be saying evil of them behind their
backs. Such men can live down temporary calumny, and almost take a
delight in the isolation which it will produce. Lord Fawn knew well
that he was not such a man. He would have described his own weakness
as caused, perhaps, by a too thin-skinned sensitiveness. Those who
knew him were inclined to say that he lacked strength of character,
and, perhaps, courage.</p>

<p>He had certainly engaged himself to marry this widow, and he was most
desirous to do what was right. He had said that he would not marry
her unless she would give up the necklace, and he was most desirous
to be true to his word. He had been twice insulted, and he was
anxious to support these injuries with dignity. Poor Lucy’s little
offence against him rankled in his mind with the other great
offences. That this humble friend of his mother’s should have been so
insolent was a terrible thing to him. He was not sure even whether
his own sisters did not treat him with scantier reverence than of
yore. And yet he was so anxious to do right, and do his duty in that
state of life to which it had pleased God to call him! As to much he
was in doubt; but of two things he was quite sure,—that Frank
Greystock was a scoundrel, and that Lucy Morris was the most
impertinent young woman in England.</p>

<p>“What would you wish to have done, Frederic?” his mother said to him
on his return.</p>

<p>“In what respect, mother?”</p>

<p>“About Lucy Morris? I have not seen her yet. I have thought it better
that she should be left to herself for a while before I did so. I
suppose she must come down to dinner. She always does.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to interfere with the young lady’s meals.”</p>

<p>“No;—but about meeting her? If there is to be no talking it will be
so very unpleasant. It will be unpleasant to us all, but I am
thinking chiefly of you.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish anybody to be disturbed for my comfort.” A young woman
coming down to dinner as though in disgrace, and not being spoken to
by any one, would, in truth, have had rather a soothing effect upon
Lord Fawn, who would have felt that the general silence and dulness
had been produced as a sacrifice in his honour. “I can, of course,
insist that she should apologise; but if she refuses, what shall I do
then?”</p>

<p>“Let there be no more apologies, if you please, mother.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do then, Frederic?”</p>

<p>“Miss Morris’s idea of an apology is a repetition of her offence with
increased rudeness. It is not for me to say what you should do. If it
be true that she is engaged to that <span class="nowrap">man—”</span></p>

<p>“It is true, certainly.”</p>

<p>“No doubt that will make her quite independent of you, and I can
understand that her presence here in such circumstances must be very
uncomfortable to you all. No doubt she feels her power.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Frederic, you do not know her.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly say that I desire to know her better. You cannot
suppose that I can be anxious for further intimacy with a young lady
who has twice given me the lie in your house. Such conduct is, at
least, very unusual; and as no absolute punishment can be inflicted,
the offender can only be avoided. It is thus, and thus only, that
such offences can be punished. I shall be satisfied if you will give
her to understand that I should prefer that she should not address me
again.”</p>

<p>Poor Lady Fawn was beginning to think that Lucy was right in saying
that there was no remedy for all these evils but that she should go
away. But whither was she to go? She had no home but such home as she
could earn for herself by her services as a governess, and in her
present position it was almost out of the question that she should
seek another place. Lady Fawn, too, felt that she had pledged herself
to Mr. Greystock that till next year Lucy should have a home at Fawn
Court. Mr. Greystock, indeed, was now an enemy to the family; but
Lucy was not an enemy, and it was out of the question that she should
be treated with real enmity. She might be scolded, and scowled at,
and put into a kind of drawing-room Coventry for a time,—so that all
kindly intercourse with her should be confined to school-room work
and bed-room conferences. She could be generally “sat upon,” as Nina
would call it. But as for quarrelling with her,—making a real enemy
of one whom they all loved, one whom Lady Fawn knew to be “as good as
gold,” one who had become so dear to the old lady that actual
extrusion from their family affections would be like the cutting off
of a limb,—that was simply impossible. “I suppose I had better go
and see her,” said Lady Fawn,—“and I have got such a headache.”</p>

<p>“Do not see her on my account,” said Lord Fawn. The duty, however,
was obligatory, and Lady Fawn with slow steps sought Lucy in the
school-room.</p>

<p>“Lucy,” she said, seating herself, “what is to be the end of all
this?”</p>

<p>Lucy came up to her and knelt at her feet. “If you knew how unhappy I
am because I have vexed you!”</p>

<p>“I am unhappy, my dear, because I think you have been betrayed by
warm temper into misbehaviour.”</p>

<p>“I know I have.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you not control your temper?”</p>

<p>“If anybody were to come to you, Lady Fawn, and make horrible
accusations against Lord Fawn, or against Augusta, would not you be
angry? Would you be able to stand it?”</p>

<p>Lady Fawn was not clear-headed; she was not clever; nor was she even
always rational. But she was essentially honest. She knew that she
would fly at anybody who should in her presence say such bitter
things of any of her children as Lord Fawn had said of Mr. Greystock
in Lucy’s hearing;—and she knew also that Lucy was entitled to hold
Mr. Greystock as dearly as she held her own sons and daughters. Lord
Fawn, at Fawn Court, could not do wrong. That was a tenet by which
she was obliged to hold fast. And yet Lucy had been subjected to
great cruelty. She thought awhile for a valid argument. “My dear,”
she said, “your youth should make a difference.”</p>

<p>“Of course it should.”</p>

<p>“And though to me and to the girls you are as dear as any friend can
be, and may say just what you please— Indeed, we all live here in
such a way that we all do say just what we please,—young and old
together. But you ought to know that Lord Fawn is different.”</p>

<p>“Ought he to say that Mr. Greystock is not a gentleman to me?”</p>

<p>“We are, of course, very sorry that there should be any quarrel. It
is all the fault of that—nasty, false young woman.”</p>

<p>“So it is, Lady Fawn. Lady Fawn, I have been thinking about it all
the day, and I am quite sure that I had better not stay here while
you and the girls think badly of Mr. Greystock. It is not only about
Lord Fawn, but because of the whole thing. I am always wanting to say
something good about Mr. Greystock, and you are always thinking
something bad about him. You have been to me,—oh, the very best
friend that a girl ever had. Why you should have treated me so
generously I never could know.”</p>

<p>“Because we have loved you.”</p>

<p>“But when a girl has got a man whom she loves, and has promised to
marry, he must be her best friend of all. Is it not so, Lady Fawn?”
The old woman stooped down and kissed the girl who had got the man.
“It is not ingratitude to you that makes me think most of him; is
it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, dear.”</p>

<p>“Then I had better go away.”</p>

<p>“But where will you go, Lucy?”</p>

<p>“I will consult Mr. Greystock.”</p>

<p>“But what can he do, Lucy? It will only be a trouble to him. He can’t
find a home for you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they would have me at the deanery,” said Lucy slowly. She
had evidently been thinking much of it all. “And, Lady Fawn, I will
not go down-stairs while Lord Fawn is here; and when he comes,—if he
does come again while I am here,—he shall not be troubled by seeing
me. He may be sure of that. And you may tell him that I don’t defend
myself, only I shall always think that he ought not to have said that
Mr. Greystock wasn’t a gentleman before me.” When Lady Fawn left Lucy
the matter was so far settled that Lucy had neither been asked to
come down to dinner, nor had she been forbidden to seek another home.</p>
