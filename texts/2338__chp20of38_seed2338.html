<!-- chapter title: CHAPTER VIII -->

<p>To a curious and unimpassioned observer of human nature, aware of the different impulses moving each mind, the party that assembled for the Spelling Bee at Kirkcudbright might have been an interesting sight.</p>

<p>Lady Kirkcudbright, universally urbane and courteous had received them all; the duchess, standing at her elbow, somewhat nervous and eager had helped her. She had driven over to luncheon, bringing with her a huge dictionary, the duke, and a Mr. Spiegel, a clever friend of the duke, who was to act as umpire during the proceeedings. When she saw Lord Swansea, who had come down the night before, she smiled and put out her hand to him; then turned immediately to Lady Kirkcudbright, with an ominous frown, and asked —</p>

<p>“Why did you ask the old fellow with the boots? He can’t spell.”</p>

<p>Now, none of them had ever seen a Spelling Bee before; the duchess and Fanny, guilded only by their own imaginations, had undertaken the management of this one.</p>

<p>“Let us do it like they have the mental arithmetic at schools,” said Fanny. “Whoever spells best goes up to the top.”</p>

<p>“The one who spells worst can have my dictionary,” said the duchess.</p>

<p>“We will only give that out at the end of it all.”</p>

<p>So they arranged it, artfully placing those who imagined they might spell worst at the top, that they might add to the amusement by having continually to go down lower.</p>

<p>Mr. Spiegel sat at a table covered with papers; three large dictionaries, among which the duchess’s was conspicuous, were in front of him; the rest of the party branched off from him in a long line reaching nearly to the end of the room.</p>

<p>The duchess found herself seated quite at the bottom of the class.</p>

<p>Lady Kircudbright was about the centre; Mr. Hawkshaw, senior, was just above her - he was all anxiety and eagerness; Lady Kirkcudbright could hardly refrain from showing the dislike she felt towards him. The duke was below her — he was as quiet as a mouse, with just a twinkle of merriment on his face; beside him was Alice, and on the other side sat Miss Rosanna Weatherwax, a friend of Mr. Camelford — rumor said she was his first love; however that may be, she has now long passed her first bloom, and Mrs. Camelford need have no sort of anxiety on her score. She grew by turns red and white, partly at being seated next a duke, and partly at the thought that she might have to raiser her voice in public, or risk being sent to the bottom of the class — a terribly degredation for a lone gentlewoman. Mrs. Camelford seems to be thinking of nothing but her clothes; Mrs. Hawkshaw is seated next to her, and so overshadows her that Mrs. Camelford cannot manage to show some very old black lace she has on her gown, which belonged to her paternal grandmother. Julius is at the bottom, next to the duchess, with Katie on the other side of him; he has hardlh spoken to Fanny, but he is watching her carefully. It is not a wise occupation, and he knows it; so many eyes are on him, and his own eyes drink in sweet poison as he looks.</p>

<p>Since that meeting in the fog, there have been chance passings, rare looks, chance words in the hunting field, light phrases that perhaps meant nothing, swift flashes of colour, glimpses of smiles; and then — at first, subtle, unconscious, involuntary — a sweet hope began to creep into his life with regard to Fanny; now it gains force every day. At first, was it a dream? —dim, vague, untenable, impossible, but infinitely sweet as all such dreams are — ay, so sweet it cannot be let go — he hust dwell on it yet a little longer; and, so dwelling on it, the colours gain depth, the lines take firmness, there comes a chance over it — it is no longer a dim ideal, it becomes possible, it might be a reality. Once reached this stage, was it likely to be soon eradicated from his life?</p>

<p>But Lord Swansea is seated now next to Fanny; he dares not look too often. Julius trusts her now; he would not fear an army of peers; with no such glamour as that will she be tempted! Yet ... he wishes he were sitting by her now, instead of Lord Swansea.</p>

<p>Mr. Camelford is at the top, next to Lord Kirkcudbright, with Moll, and Miss Gauntlet, another lady who had also passed her youth; she lives just beyond the park, is large-hearted and public-spirited; and then comes Dlaton, and after him Dick. They are bent on being sent down to the bottom soon. Dick wants to go and shoot pigeons.</p>

<p>“It has been arranged, I think,” said Mr. Spiegel, looking down the line as if he were afraid of it, and could never get right to the end, “that we should spell in rotation, and that whoever spells best should pass the other competitors over whom he has triumphed, and come up to the top.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear,” said Dick and Dalton, stamping with their feet.</p>

<p>“Hear, hear,” said Mr. Hawkshaw. “So far, so good — hunderstood.”</p>

<p>“Every competitor has, I think.” continued Mr. Spiegel, appealing timidly to the duchess, and laying his hand lightly over the papers as though he would bless them, “every competitor has, I think, contributed three words. The person whose words they are should maintain silence when they are given out.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, that is very nice,” hazarded Miss Rosanna Weatherwax, but, getting no response while Mr. Spiegel sought among the papers, she felt snubbed, and wished the earth would open and swallow her up.</p>

<p>“Borough?” said Mr. Spiegel, elevating his voice and his eyebrows. “Signed ‘Elephant.’”</p>

<p>“‘Helephant!’ — that’s me,” exclaimed Mr. Hawkshaw, sitting very forward and and clapping his hands on his knees.</p>

<p>“Hush, my dear sir. You needn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, beg pardon. I thought you’d wonder why I didn’t spell it if I didn’t say that I was ‘Helephant.’”</p>

<p>“B-o-r-o-u-g-h,” said everybody.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” said Mr. Hawkshaw triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked the duke mildly, turning to him.</p>

<p>“Hush, my dear sir. It’s for me to tell them.”</p>

<p>“But it’s wrong, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, you have put ‘burgh,’ I’ll allow. I must look in the dictionary. Your authority is —?”</p>

<p>“B-u-r-g-h-e-r, ictizen, is burgher, sir,” said Mr. Hawkshaw, ” so it stands to reason that b-u-r-g-h, city, ust be burgh, too. Humph!”</p>

<p>“Is that so, Spiegel?” asked the duke doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Stenzler has it b-o-r-o-u-g-h, Fox has it b-u-r-g-h, Searchwell has it b-u-r-g-h, Petty has it b-o-r-o-u-g-h.”</p>

<p>“Louisa,” said the duke, leaning forward and adjusting his eyeglass as he looked at the duchess, “did I not explain to you that these Spelling Bees are foolish things?”</p>

<p>“I fancy the older writers have it ‘b-u-r-g-h,’” continued Mr. Spiegel; “the modern ones insert the <em>o</em> and the <em>u</em>.”</p>

<p>“And yet I’m a modern man, sir,” said Mr. Hawkshaw. “I’m all for progress.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly you are, sir,” said Lord Swansea. “Your dictionary is by newman, I should think, and your grammar by No-man.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mr. Hawkshaw did not hear the grammatical insult.</p>

<p>“My dictionary is by Strange, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I dar say. A good man, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“A pity you came all the way from London, Lord Swansea, if you cannot teach your country friends to spell without quarrelling,” said Fanny angrily.”

<p>“I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it does not matter to me.”</p>

<p>“Am I forgiven?”</p>

<p>“That is too great a word for such a mere breach of manners,” returned she, looking away.</p>

<p>A breach of manners! A belted earl of one of the oldest families of England to be told that by a mere girl, of his conduct towards an old pill-merchant!</p>

<p>“Really, Lady Fanny —”</p>

<p>“Auricle?” gave out Mr. Spiegel.</p>

<p>“O-r-a-c-l-e,” said everybody else.</p>

<p>“Dun ‘em! That’s dun ‘em again!” exclaimed Mr. Hawkshaw. “Thought it would.”</p>

<p>“Wrong! Hush, my dear sir,” entreated Mr. Spiegel.</p>

<p>“Peter, will you hold your tongue?” exclaimed Mrs. Hawksaw.</p>

<p>“You see it sounds different to what it’s spelt. Thought it would do ‘em.”</p>

<p>The duchess put her hand up.</p>

<p>Mr. Spiegel bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>“Her Grace has the speaker’s ear,” said Lord Kirkcudbright.</p>

<p>“A-u-r-i-c-l-e,” said the duchess.</p>

<p>“Right, right as a trivet! Your Grace has dun ‘em hall. Step up to the top!”</p>

<p>“Oh, pa, you shouldn’t talk for ever,” said Moll.</p>

<p>“Hospital?” called Mr. Spiegel, evidently humself puzzled at the facility of the word.</p>

<p>Everybody spelt it right.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawkshaw leaned forward and heard it amazed.</p>

<p>“Well now — that’s odd; very odd.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you expect us to spell anything at all, Mr. Hawkshaw?” asked Mr. Camelford.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, Peter,” said Mrs. Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>“Yes. But now that is odd, for it is pronounced quite differently from what you say it. I shan’t be quiet, my dear!”</p>

<p>“How do you pronounce it, Mr. Hawkshaw?” asked Lady Kircudbright severely.</p>

<p>“Why, ma’am, ‘horspital, of course; and a ‘orse is a different thing from a ‘oss — leastways, it ought to be.”</p>

<p>“We say hos,” said the duke, looking at a mild rebuke towards Fanny and Alice, who were indulging in smiles, and towards Dalton and Moll, who were having a playful passage of arms about “plumb” and a “plum.”</p>

<p>“But I was always taught to say ‘ors; like one says ‘umble, or gentlemanlike, or anything else as one says contrary to what one writes it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, really!”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Dalton gravely. Go on, if you please, Mr. Spiegel.”</p>

<p>“Now attend, Peter.”</p>

<p>After that, this assemblage of growp-up people because too much like a game called “Post,” which the children play (sp rapid were the changes of place), ofr us to follow it in detail. Mr. Hawkshaw and Mrs. Camelford were heard arguing hotly about “rein” and “rain;” “Do be quiet, Peter!” in a certain well-known bass voice, was the end of it. Moll and Lord Kircudbright differed about “pererration” a wandering, and “peroration,” to the discomfiture of Moll, poor Miss Weatherwax flitted about from seat to seat with much perturbation of spirit. “Reel” and “tail,” “ruff” and “sale,” did much for Miss Gauntlet, and “broccoli” was a lasting feather in Mrs. Hawkshaw’s cap.</p>

<p>The strife of tongues, the heated arguments, the startling differences of opinion between the cometitors and between his three huge dictionaries, more than occupied poor gentle Mr. Spiegel. The combativeness of Mr. Hawkshaw was the last straw that threatened to break his back, though shared to the full by Julius, who was longing, as with a sickness of the soul, that some pressing call of business might have kept his father in the City, just for that day, and that he might have been spared these pangs of shame. The suppressed laguther over the words “asperate” to make rough, and “aspirate,” to sound the <em>h</em>, was bitter; almost more bitter was it, when Mr. Hawkshaw, triumphing at “poller,” a voter, to the annihilation of “polar,” “pole,” and “poll,” passed the duchess, of them all. Till then aggressive, he was now utterly irrepressible. But Fanny passed him at the word “asparagus,” and Julius passed at the almost unknown word “wey” — a measure of corn; and then, Lord Swansea and his father quite forgotten, once enthroned there by her side, he was content. Alas! short triumph! Love-making and spelling can cardly succeed together; first Julius stumbled at “tetreahexahedral,” then Dick ousted Fanny at “tenour,” having meant a “tenner;” and, finally, having fallen lower and lower over “pumice” and “anice,” over the verbs “to pur” and “to whet,” “apophthegm” crushed them, and the duchess, to her great satisfaction, saw them both go down to the bottom together, whence she knew they would never rise.</p>

<p>How capricious is fortune! Lord Swansea’s star had been steadily on the ascendant. Now — strange fate! — his triumph is cut short, and he is shambling down — patent leather boots being tight to-day — even to below Julius. From where he sits he can hear all that Julius and Fanny say. Lady Kirkcudbright smiles as he passes her, but he fancies the duchess has a frown on her brow, and not even the condescension to pity him.</p>

<p>But he had been unwary.</p>

<p>“Sow,” then said Mr. Spiegel.</p>

<p>“S-e-w,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” said Mr. Spiegel.</p>

<p>“S-o-w,” said Lord Swansea.</p>

<p>Up once more! He sinks with ready ease and unctuous smile on to the sofa by her side. There was no answering welcome on Lady Fanny’s face for him.</p>

<p>“Vein,” calls Mr. Spiegel.</p>

<p>“V-a-n-e,” says Mr. Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>“Va-i-n,” says the duchess.</p>

<p>“V-e-i-n,” calls out Julius.</p>

<p>“Right!” says Mr. Spiegel.</p>

<p>And down they both come to the bottom, the duchess sitting by Julius.</p>

<p>“Why does the duchess talk to the old man so much?” grumbled Lord Swansea to humself. “Am I never to get a word with Fanny?”</p>

<p>“I like being at the bottom,” said Julius to Fanny. “And you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it too.”</p>

<p>“I am glad now I came to-day.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would.”</p>

<p>“You may always be sure that I will do anything that I think may please you.”</p>

<p>“You are not spelling, Lady Fanny,” put in Lord Swansea.</p>

<p>“I, oh — ‘Choir.’ C-h-o-i-r.”</p>

<p>“Q-u-i-r-e,” said Lord Swansea.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” said Mr. Spiegel. “Lady Fanny, go up one.”</p>

<p>So Fanny had to change, and Lrd Swansea sat beside Julius, and was the barrier between them he had so desired to be.</p>

<p>“An amusing game, is it not?” said he politely to Julius.</p>

<p>“Very, indeed,” answered Julius.</p>

<p>But when things are at their worst they mend, and Fanny was soon let out of her durance vile, by Mr. Spiegel declaring that that was all.</p>

<p>“And the prize,” he added, “as in some other races of which we have heard, is to be given to the last in. Mr. Hawkshaw, senior, he continued, rising as he spoke, with the huge dictionary in his hands, “allow me to present you with this magnificent volume, occupying, as you do, the lowest seat at this meeting.”</p>

<p>Applause, and “Hear, hear!”</p>

<p>“I should be ashamed, Peter, that I should! A man of your age, too!”</p>

<p>“If pa hadn’t talked so much, he’d have spelt ever so much better,” suggested Moll.</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me, how very funny,” said Miss Weatherwax.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I had known,” said Katie.</p>

<p>“How very nice to be sure,” said Miss Gauntlet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Peter, how could you!” exclaimed Mrs. Hawkshaw, suffering from a second burst of indignation.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said he, as he tripped up to the table, laughing and rubbing his hands, “every position has its advantages. The last shall be first. Your Grace, I thank you heartily, I’m sure. Now, Liz and Moll, you’d better look out, I can tell you, for now I have the Duchess of Arranmore’s own dictionary, I can set you all to rights.”</p>

<p>Later, when Fanny had poured out the tea and everyone had been waited upon, when, too, they had scattered themselves about the drawing-room in different groups, she found herself standing looking out of the window, and Julius stood beside her.</p>

<p>The window was in an embrasure, there was a flower-stand in the center of it, and the curtains there partly hid them from the rest; Fanny thought they were quite unnoticed.</p>

<p>Julius was in a state of supreme doubt; he longed for some proof by which he might know her feelings towards him. Sometimes he thought she was merely a coquette, at other times a grave sad shy look that stole out of her eyes banished swiftly such unworthy thought, and now he was longing for some means by which he coul put the truth of that look to the test.</p>

<p>“The days are so short,” said she, looking out to the dim grey sky.</p>

<p>She was plucking a flower to pieces with impatient restless fingers as she spoke.</p>

<p>“They will be brighter soon,” said he. “Do you ever look forward, Lady Fanny?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why?”</p>

<p>“I wondered. You seem so gay, so thoughtless, so merry; and then, at times...”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes you are so earnest, so —”</p>

<p>“You know you said you would never misunderstand me again,” said she softly, half in play.</p>

<p>“Give me something then to understand you by,” said he passionately. “I am trusting you. I would do anything for you. Is it to be all for nothing? Would you fling me and my service away as you do that poor flower?”</p>

<p>For, in a sudden terror as she turned to him, stung and half frightened by his words, she had let the flower fall. In moving her arm, too, a bracelet dropped.</p>

<p>Their eyes met; neither thought of the bracelet. What could she say? How much dared she say? To whom was she to be true? — to her mother, to Julius, or to herself?</p>

<p>But an eager longing to be able unreservedly to trust some one, to be able, once for all, to be true, nearly overcame her. She smiled for a moment and their fingers met.</p>

<p>Then, in the confustion of withdrawing those too willing hands, Fanny bethought herself of the bracelet.</p>

<p>“It fell somewhere there.”</p>

<p>Julius stooped to look for it, and put it into her hands.</p>

<p>“There is a locket,” said she; — “a little golden heart.”</p>

<p>That too was found.</p>

<p>“A little golden heart,” mused he, playing with it for a moment, and his thoughts recurring to the test he had longed for — “how pretty! I wish it were mine.”</p>

<p>He looked at her earnestly.</p>

<p>“Would you lend it me for a little? It is of chased, refined gold, I see. A living heart almost, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Take it,” said she.</p>

<p>Was that the wind outside? It sounded like a note dwelling on the ear, delicious in its sweetness, lengthening out the bliss of this moment.</p>

<p>“I would return it if ever you wanted it again.”</p>

<p>“I shall not want it again.”</p>

<p>“Lady Kirkcudbright,” said Lord Swansea, striding across the room, and standing before her, while he pulled his well-waxed moustache viciously; “when a man is thinking of marrying, he does not care to see his future wife making herself remarkable with any sort of snob.”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” said Lady Kircudbright. What a terrible old man he looked all in the moment! A quallm crossed her that he might not be fit to be any woman’s husband. He looked able just now to tear her in pieces. Suppose, some day, ehr Fanny were to be torn in pieces by him.</p>

<p>“My goodness! Certainly not. What do you mean? 00 oh!” then she laughed. “You mistake! Fanny dear, come here. My daughter was only doing the civil, Lord Swansea.”</p>
