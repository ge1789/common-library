<!--CHAPTER VII. <br> LEARNING AND TEACHING.-->

<p>Easter was just gone by. The Spences
had timed their arrival in Rome so as to be
able to spend a few days with certain friends,
undisturbed by bell-clanging and the rush
of trippers, before at length returning to
England. Their hotel was in the Babuino.
Mallard, who was uncertain about his movements during the next month or two, went
to quarters with which he was familiar in
the Via Bocca di Leone. He brought his
Pæstum picture to the hotel, but declined
to leave it there. Mallard was deficient in
those properties of the showman which are
so necessary to an artist if he would make
his work widely known and sell it for substantial sums ; he hated anything like private exhibition, and dreaded an offer to purchase from any one who had come in contact with him by the way of friendly introduction.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied with it, now I come to
look at it again. It’s nothing but a rough
sketch.”</p>

<p>” But Seaborne will be here this afternoon,” urged Spence. “He will be grateful if you let him see it.”</p>

<p>“If he cares to come to my room, he shall.”</p>

<p>Miriam made no remark on the picture, but kept looking at it as long as it was uncovered. The temples stood in the light of early morning, a wonderful, indescribable light, perfectly true and rendered with great skill.</p>

<p>“Is it likely to be soon sold ?” she asked,
when the artist had gone off with his canvas.</p>

<p>” As likely as not, he’ll keep it by him for a
year or two, till he hates it for a few
faults that no one else can perceive or be
taught to understand,” was Spence’s reply. “I wish I could somehow become possessed
of it. But if I hinted such a wish, he would
insist on my taking it as a present. An
impracticable fellow, Mallard. He suspects
I want to sell it for him ; that’s why he
won’t leave it. And if Seaborne goes to
his room, ten to one he’ll be received with
growls of surly independence.”</p>

<p>This Mr. Seaborne was a man of letters.
Spence had made his acquaintance in Rome
a year ago ; they conversed casually in
Piale’s reading-room, and Seaborne happened
to say that the one English landscape-painter
who strongly interested him was a little-known
man, Ross Mallard. His own work
was mostly anonymous ; he wrote for one
of the quarterlies and one of the weekly
reviews. He was a little younger than
Mallard, whom in certain respects he resembled ; he had much the same way of speaking, the same reticence with regard to his own doings, even a slight similarity of feature, and his life seemed to be rather a lonely one.</p>

<p>When the two met, they behaved precisely
as Spence predicted they would—with reserve, almost with coldness. For all that,
Seaborne paid a visit to the artist’s room,
and in a couple of hours’ talk they arrived at
a fair degree of mutual understanding. The
next day they smoked together in an odd
abode occupied by the literary man near
Porto di Ripetta, and thenceforth were good
friends.</p>

<p>The morning after that, Mallard went early
to the Vatican. He ascended the Scala
Regia, and knocked at the little red door over
which is written, “Cappella Sistina.” On
entering, he observed only a gentleman and
a young girl, who stood in the middle of
the floor, consulting their guide-book ; but
when he had taken a few steps forward, he
saw a lady come from the far end and seat
herself to look at the ceiling through an
opera-glass. It was Mrs. Baske, and he
approached whilst she was still intent on
the frescoes. The pausing of his footstep
close to her caused her to put down the glass and regard him. Mallard noticed the
sudden change from cold remoteness of
countenance to pleased recognition. The
brightening in her eyes was only for a
moment ; then she smiled in her usual half-absent
way, and received him formally.</p>

<p>“You are not alone ?” he said, taking a
place by her as she resumed her seat.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have come alone.” And, after
a pause, she added, “We don’t think it
necessary always to keep together. That
would become burdensome. I often leave
them, and go to places by myself.”</p>

<p>Her look was still turned upwards.
Mallard followed its direction.</p>

<p>“Which of the Sibyls is your favourite ?”
he asked.</p>

<p>At once she indicated the Delphic, but
without speaking.</p>

<p>“Mine too.”</p>

<p>Both fixed their eyes upon the figure, and
were silent.</p>

<p>” You have been here very often ?” were
Mallard’s next words.</p>

<p>“Last year very often.”</p>

<p>“From genuine love of it, or a sense of
duty ?” he asked, examining her face.</p>

<p>She considered before replying.</p>

<p>” Not only from a sense of duty, though
of course I have felt that. I don’t <i>love</i>
anything of Michael Angelo’s, but I am compelled to look and study. I came here this
morning only to refresh my memory of one
of those faces “—she pointed to the lower
part of the Last Judgment —” and yet the
face is dreadful to me.”</p>

<p>She found that he was smiling, and
abruptly she added the question :</p>

<p>” Do you love that picture ?”</p>

<p>” Why, no ; but I often delight in it. I
wouldn’t have it always before me (for that
matter, no more would I have the things
that I love). A great work of art may be
painful at all times, and sometimes unendurable.”</p>

<p>“I have learnt to understand that,” she
said, with something of humility, which
came upon Mallard as new and agreeable. “But—it is not long since that scene
represented a reality to me. I think I shall
never see it as you do.”</p>

<p>Mallard wished to look at her, but did
not.</p>

<p>“I have sometimes been repelled by a
feeling of the same kind,” he answered. “Not that I myself ever thought of it as a
reality, but I have felt angry and miserable
in remembering that a great part of the
world does. You see the pretty girl there,
with her father. I noticed her awed face
as I passed, and heard a word or two of the
man’s, which told me that for them there
was no question of <i>art</i>. Poor child ! I
should have liked to pat her hand, and tell
her to be good and have no fear.”</p>

<p>“Did Michael Angelo believe it?”
Miriam asked diffidently, when she had
glanced with anxious eyes at the pair of
whom he spoke.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. And yet I am far from
sure. What about Dante ? Haven’t you
sometimes stumbled over his grave assurances that this and that did really befall
him ? Putting aside the feeble notion that
he was a deluded visionary, how does one
reconcile the artist’s management of his
poem with the Christian’s stern faith ? In
any case, he was more poet than Christian
when he wrote. Milton makes no such
claims ; he merely prays for the enlightenment of his imagination.”</p>

<p>Miriam turned from the great fresco, and
again gazed at the Sibyls and Prophets.</p>

<p>” Do the Stanze interest you ?” was
Mallard’s next question.</p>

<p>“Very little, I am sorry to say. They
soon weary me.”</p>

<p>” And the Loggia ?”</p>

<p>“I never paid much attention to it.”</p>

<p>“That surprises me. Those little pictures are my favourites of all Raphael’s
work. For those and the Psyche, I would
give everything else.”</p>

<p>Miriam looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Are you again thinking of the subjects ?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. I can’t help it. I have avoided
them, because I knew how impossible it
was for me to judge them only as art.”</p>

<p>Then you have the same difficulty with
nearly all Italian pictures ?”</p>

<p>She hesitated ; but, without turning her
eyes to him, said at length :</p>

<p>“I can’t easily explain to you the distinction there is for me between the Old
Testament and the New. I was taught
almost exclusively out of the Old—at
least, it seems so to me. I have had to
study the New for myself, and it helps
rather than hinders my enjoyment of pictures taken from it. The religion of my
childhood was one of bitterness and violence
and arbitrary judgment and hatred.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but there is quite another side to
the Old Testament—those parts of it, at
all events, that are illustrated up in the
Loggia. Will you come up there with
me?”</p>

<p>She rose without speaking. They left
the chapel, and ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>“You are not under the impression,” he
said, with a smile, as they walked side by
side, “that the Old Testament is responsible for those horrors we have just been
speaking of ?”</p>

<p>“They are in <i>that</i> spirit. My reading
of the New omits everything of the kind.”</p>

<p>“So does mine. But we have no justification.”</p>

<p>“We can select what is useful to us, and
reject what does harm.”</p>

<p>” Yes ; but then—-“</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, and they
went into the pictured Loggia. Here,
choosing out his favourites, Mallard endeavoured to explain all his joy in them.
He showed her how it was Hebrew history
made into a series of exquisite and touching
legends ; he dwelt on the sweet, idyllic
treatment, the lovely landscape, the tender
idealism throughout, the perfect adaptedness
of gem-like colouring—-though that, of
course, is not Raphael’s hand. Jacob meeting Rachel at the well ; Joseph telling his dream ; the meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek
— how the essence of pastoral poetry is expressed in those groups !</p>

<p>Miriam endeavoured to see with his eyes,
but did not pretend to be wholly successful. The very names were discordant to her ear.</p>

<p>“I will buy some photographs of them
to take away,” she said.</p>

<p>” Don’t do that ; they are useless. Colour
and design are here inseparable.”</p>

<p>They stayed not more than half an hour ;
then left the Vatican together, and walked
to the front of St. Peter’s in silence. Mallard looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“You are going back to the hotel ?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Shall I call one of those carriages ?—I
am going to have a walk on to the Janiculum.”</p>

<p>She glanced at the sky.</p>

<p>“There will be a fine view to-day.”</p>

<p>” You wouldn’t care to come so far ?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should enjoy the walk.”</p>

<p>” To walk ? It would tire you too
much.”</p>

<p>” Oh no !” replied Miriam, looking away
and smiling. ” You mustn’t think I am
what I was that winter at Naples. I can
walk a good many miles, and only feel
better for it.”</p>

<p>Her tone amused him, for it became
something like that of a child in self-defence
when accused of some childlike incapacity.</p>

<p>“Then let us go, by all means.”</p>

<p>They turned into the Borgo San Spirito,
and then went by the quiet Longara.
Mallard soon found that it was necessary
to moderate his swinging stride. He was
not in the habit of walking with ladies,
and he felt ashamed of himself when a
glance told him that his companion was
put to overmuch exertion. The glance led
him to observe Miriam’s gait ; its grace
and refinement gave him a sudden sensation of keen pleasure. He thought, without wishing to do so, of Cecily ; her matchless, maidenly charm in movement was something of quite another kind. Mrs. Baske trod the common earth, yet with,
it seemed to him, a dignity that distinguished her from ordinary women.</p>

<p>There had been silence for a long time.
They were alike in the custom of forgetting
what had last been said, or how long
since.</p>

<p>” Do you care for sculpture ?” Mallard
asked, led to the inquiry by his thoughts
of form and motion.</p>

<p>” Yes ; but not so much as for painting.”</p>

<p>He noticed a reluctance in her voice, and
for a moment was quite unconscious of the
reason for it. But reflection quickly explained her slight embarrassment.</p>

<p>” Edward makes it one of his chief
studies,” she added at once, looking straight
before her. ” He has told me what to
read about it.”</p>

<p>Mallard let the subject fall. But presently they passed a yoke of oxen drawing
a cart, and, as he paused to look at them, he said :</p>

<p>” Don’t you like to watch those animals ?
I can never be near them without stopping.
Look at their grand heads, their horns,
their majestic movement ! They always
remind me of the antique —of splendid
power fixed in marble. These are the kind
of oxen that Homer saw, and Virgil.”</p>

<p>Miriam gazed, but said nothing.</p>

<p>” Does your silence mean that you can’t
sympathize with me ?”</p>

<p>” No. It means that you have given me
a new way of looking at a thing ; and I
have to think.”</p>

<p>She paused ; then, with a curious inflection of her voice, as though she were
not quite certain of the tone she wished to
strike, whether playful or sarcastic :</p>

<p>” You wouldn’t prefer me to make an
exclamation ?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>” Decidedly not. If you were apt to do
so, I should not be expressing my serious
thoughts.”</p>

<p>The pleasant mood continued with him, and, a smile still on his face, he asked presently :</p>

<p>” Do you remember telling me that you
thought I was wasting my life on futilities ?”</p>

<p>Miriam flushed, and for an instant he
thought he had offended her. But her
reply corrected this impression.</p>

<p>” You admitted, I think, that there was
much to be said for my view.”</p>

<p>“Did I ? Well, so there is. But the
same conviction may be reached by very
different paths. If we agreed in that one
result, I fancy it was the sole and singular
point of concord.”</p>

<p>Miriam inquired diffidently :</p>

<p>” Do you still think of most things just
as you did then ?”</p>

<p>” Of most things, yes.”</p>

<p>“You have found no firmer hope in which
to work ?”</p>

<p>” Hope ? I am not sure that I understand
you.”</p>

<p>He looked her in the face, and she said hurriedly :</p>

<p>“Are you still as far as ever from satisfying yourself? Does your work bring you
nothing but a comparative satisfaction ?”</p>

<p>“I am conscious of having progressed an
inch or two on the way of infinity,” Mallard
replied. ” That brings me no nearer to an
end.”</p>

<p>” But you <i>have</i> a purpose ; you follow it steadily. It is much to be able to say that.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it for consolation ?”</p>

<p>“Not in any sense that you need resent,”
Miriam gave answer, a little coldly.</p>

<p>“I felt no resentment. But I should like
to know what sanction of a life’s effort you
look for, now ? We talked once, perhaps
you remember, of one kind of work being ‘higher’
than another. How do you think
now on that subject ?”</p>

<p>She made delay before saying :</p>

<p>“It is long since I thought of it at
all. I have been too busy learning the
simplest things to trouble about the most
difficult.”</p>

<p>” To learn, then, has been <i>your</i> object all this time. Let me question you in turn.
Do you find it all-sufficient ?”</p>

<p>” No ; because I have begun too late.
I am doing now what I ought to have done
when I was a girl, and I have always the
feeling of being behindhand.”</p>

<p>“But the object, in itself, quite apart
from your progress ? Is it enough to study
a variety of things, and feel that you make
some progress towards a possible ideal of
education ? Does this suffice to your life ?”</p>

<p>She answered confusedly :</p>

<p>“I can’t know yet ; I can’t see before me
clearly enough.”</p>

<p>Mallard was on the point of pressing the
question, but he refrained, and shaped his
thought in a different way.</p>

<p>” Do you think of remaining in England ?”</p>

<p>“Probably I shall.”</p>

<p>“You will return to your home in Lancashire ?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t yet determined,” she replied
formally.</p>

<p>The dialogue seemed to be at an end. Unobservant of each other, they reached the
Via Crucis which leads up to S. Pietro in
Montorio. Arrived at the terrace, they
stood to look down on Rome.</p>

<p>” After all, you are tired,” said Mallard,
when he had glanced at her.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am not.”</p>

<p>“But you are hungry. We have been
forgetting that it is luncheon-time.”</p>

<p>“I pay little attention to such hours.
One can always get something to eat.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for people like myself
to talk in that way,” said Mallard, with a
smile, ” but ladies have orderly habits of
life.”</p>

<p>” For which you a little despise them ?
” she returned, with grave face fixed on the
landscape.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. It’s only that I regard
their life as wholly different from my own.
Since I was a boy, I have known nothing of
domestic regularity.”</p>

<p>” You sometimes visit your relatives ?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But their life cannot be mine. It is domestic in such a degree that it only
serves to remind me how far apart I am.”</p>

<p>” Do you hold that an artist cannot live
like other people, in the habits of home ?”</p>

<p>“I think such habits are a danger to him. >
He <i>may</i> find a home, if fate is exceptionally kind.”</p>

<p>Pointing northwards to a ridged hill on
the horizon, he asked in another voice if she
knew its name.</p>

<p>” You mean Mount Soracte ?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You don’t know Latin, or it
would make you quote Horace.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, looked down, and
spoke more humbly than he had ever yet
heard her.</p>

<p>” But I know it in an English translation.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s more than most ladies do.”</p>

<p>He said it in a grudging way. The
remark itself was scarcely civil, but he
seemed all at once to have a pleasure in
speaking roughly, in reminding her of her
shortcomings. Miriam turned her eyes in
another quarter, and presently pointed to
the far blue hills just seen between the
Alban and the Sabine ranges.</p>

<p>“Through there is the country of the
Volsci,” she said, in a subdued voice.
“Some Roman must have stood here and
looked towards it, in days when Rome was
struggling for supremacy with that tribe.
Think of all that happened between that
day and the time when Horace saw the
snow on Soracte ; and then, of all that has
happened since.”</p>

<p>He watched her face, and nodded several
times. They pursued the subject, and
reminded each other of what the scene
suggested, point by point. Mallard felt
surprise, though he showed none. Cecily,
standing here, would have spoken with
more enthusiasm, but it was doubtful
whether she would have displayed Miriam’s
accuracy of knowledge.</p>

<p>“Well, let us go,” he said at length. “You don’t insist on walking home ?”</p>

<p>“There is no need to, I think. I could quite well, if I wished.”</p>

<p>“I am going to run through a few of the
galleries for a morning or two. I wonder
whether you would care to come with me
to-morrow ?”</p>

<p>“I will come with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“That is how people speak when they
don’t like to refuse a troublesome invitation.”</p>

<p>“Then what am I to say ? I spoke the
truth, in quite simple words.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was your tone ; you seemed
too polite.”</p>

<p>“But what is your objection to politeness?” Miriam asked naïvely.</p>

<p>” Oh, I have none, when it is sincere.
But as soon as I had asked you, I felt afraid
that I was troublesome.”</p>

<p>“If I had felt that, I should have expressed
it unmistakably,” she replied, in a voice
which reminded him of the road from Baiæ
to Naples.</p>

<p>“Thank you ; that is what I should wish.”</p>

<p>Having found a carriage for her, and
made an appointment for the morning, he watched her drive away.</p>

<p>A few hours later, he encountered Spence
in the Piazza Colonna, and they went together
into a <i>caffè</i>. Spence had the news that Mrs.
Lessingham and her niece would arrive on
the third day from now. Their stay would
be of a fortnight at longest.</p>

<p>“I met Mrs. Baske at the Vatican this
morning,” said Mallard presently, as he
knocked the ash off his cigar. ” We had
some talk.”</p>

<p>“On Vatican subjects ?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I find her views of art somewhat changed. But sculpture still alarms her.”</p>

<p>“Still ? Do you suppose she will ever
overcome that feeling ? Are you wholly
free from it yourself? Imagine yourself
invited to conduct a party of ladies through
the marbles, and to direct their attention to
the merits that strike you.”</p>

<p>“No doubt I should invent an excuse.
But it would be weakness.”</p>

<p>” A weakness inseparable from our civilization. The nude in art is an anachronism.”</p>

<p>“Pooh ! That is encouraging the vulgar
prejudice.”</p>

<p>” No ; it is merely stating a vulgar fact.
These collections of nude figures in marble
have only an historical interest. They are
kept out of the way, in places which no one
is obliged to visit. Modern work of that
kind is tolerated, nothing more. What on
earth is the good of an artistic production
of which people in general are afraid to
speak freely ? You take your stand before
the Venus of the Capitol ; you bid the attendant make it revolve slowly, and you
begin a lecture to your wife, your sister, or
your young cousin, on the glories of the
masterpiece. You point out in detail how
admirably Praxiteles has exhibited every
beauty of the female frame. Other ladies
are standing by ; you smile blandly, and
include them in your audience.”</p>

<p>Mallard interrupted with a laugh.</p>

<p>” Well, why not ?” continued the other.
“This isn’t the <i>gabinetto</i> at Naples, surely? But you are well aware that, practically, it comes to the same thing, How often is one
half pained, half amused, at the behaviour of
women in the Tribune at Florence ! They
are in a false position ; it is absurd to
ridicule them for what your own sensations
justify. For my own part, I always leave
my wife and Mrs. Baske to go about these
galleries without my company. If I can’t
be honestly at my ease, I won’t make
pretence of being so.”</p>

<p>” All this is true enough, but the prejudice
is absurd. We ought to despise it and
struggle against it.”</p>

<p>“Despise it, many of us do, theoretically.
But to make practical demonstrations against it, is
to oppose, as I said, all the civilization
of our world. Perhaps there will come a
time once more when sculpture will be
justified ; at present the art doesn’t and
can’t exist. Its relics belong to museums—
in the English sense of the word.”</p>

<p>” You only mean by this,” said Mallard,
“that art isn’t for the multitude. We know that well enough.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a special difficulty about
this point. We come across it in literature
as well. How is it that certain pages in
literature, which all intellectual people agree
in pronouncing just as pure as they are
great, could never be read aloud, say, in a
family circle, without occasioning pain and
dismay ? No need to give illustrations ;
they occur to you in abundance. We skip
them, or we read mutteringly, or we say
frankly that this is not adapted for reading
aloud. Yet no man would frown if he found
his daughter bent over the book. There’s
something radically wrong here.”</p>

<p>” This is the old question of our English
Puritanism. In France, here in Italy, there
is far less of such feeling.”</p>

<p>” Far less ; but why must there be any
at all ? And Puritanism isn’t a sufficient
explanation. The English Puritans of the
really Puritan time had freedom of conversation which would horrify us of to-day. We
become more and more prudish as what we
call civilization advances. It is a hateful fact that, from the domestic point of view,
there exists no difference between some of
the noblest things in art and poetry, and
the obscenities which are prosecuted ; the
one is as impossible of frank discussion as
the other.”</p>

<p>“The domestic point of view is contemptible. It means the bourgeois point of
view, the Philistine point of view.”</p>

<p>“Then I myself, if I had children, should
be both bourgeois and Philistine. And
so, I have a strong suspicion, would you
too.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Mallard, with some
annoyance, “then it is one more reason
why an artist should have nothing to do
with domesticities. But look here, you are
wrong as regards me. If ever I marry,
<i>amico mio</i>, my wife shall learn to make
more than a theoretical distinction between
what is art and what is grossness. If ever
I have children, they shall from the first be
taught a natural morality, and not the
conventional. If I can afford good casts of noble statues, they shall stand freely about
my house. When I read aloud, by the fireside, there shall be no skipping or muttering
or frank omissions ; no, by Apollo ! If a
daughter of mine cannot describe to me the
points of difference between the Venus of
the Capitol and that of the Medici, she shall
be bidden to use her eyes and her brains
better. I’ll have no contemptible prudery
in <i>my</i> house !”</p>

<p>” Bravissimo !” cried Spence, laughing.
“I see that my cousin Miriam is not the
only person who has progressed during these
years. Do you remember a certain conversation of ours at Posilippo about the
education of a certain young lady ?”</p>

<p>” Yes, I do. But that was a different
matter. The question was not of Greek
statues and classical books, but of modern
pruriencies and shallowness and irresponsibility.”</p>

<p>“You exaggerated then, and you do so
now,” said Spence; “at present with less
excuse.”</p>

<p>Mallard kept silence for a space ; then
said :</p>

<p>“Let us speak of what we have been
avoiding. How has that marriage turned
out?”</p>

<p>“I have told you all I know. There’s
no reason to suppose that things are anything but well.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like her coming abroad alone ;
I have no faith in that plea of work. I
suspect things are <i>not</i> well.”</p>

<p>” A cynic —which I am not — would
suggest that a wish had something to do
with the thought.”</p>

<p>” He would be cynically wrong,” replied
Mallard, with calmness.</p>

<p>” Why shouldn’t she come abroad alone ?
There’s nothing alarming in the fact that
they no longer need to see each other every
hour. And one takes for granted that <i>they</i>,
at all events, are not bourgeois ; their life
won’t be arranged exactly like that of Mr.
and Mrs. Jones the greengrocers.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the other, musingly.</p>

<p>“In what direction do you imagine that
Cecily will progress ? Possibly she has
become acquainted with disillusion.”</p>

<p>“Possibly ?”</p>

<p>” Well, take it for certain. Isn’t that an
inevitable step in her education ? Things
may still be well enough, philosophically
speaking. She has her life to live—we
know it will be to the end a modern life.
<i>Servetur ad imum</i>, and so on ; that’s what
one would wish, I suppose ? We have no
longer to take thought for her.”</p>

<p>” But we are allowed to wish the best.”</p>

<p>” What is the best ?” said Spence, sustaining his tone of impartial speculation. “Are you quite sure that Mr. and Mrs. Jones are not too much in your mind ?”</p>

<p>” Whatever modern happiness may mean,
I am inclined to think that modern <i>un</i>happiness is not unlike that of old-fashioned
people.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you are a halter between
two opinions. You can’t make up your
mind in which direction to look. You are a sort of Janus, with anxiety on both faces.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of truth in that,”
admitted the artist, with a growl.</p>

<p>“Get on with your painting, and whatever else of practical you have in mind.
Leave philosophy to men of large leisure
and placid pulses, like myself. Accept the
inevitable.”</p>

<p>“I do so.”</p>

<p>” But not with modern detachment,” said
Spence, smiling.</p>

<p>” Be hanged with your modernity ! I
believe myself distinctly the more modern
of the two.”</p>

<p>“Not with regard to women. When you
marry, you will be a rigid autocrat, and
make no pretence about it. You don’t think
of women as independent beings, who must
save or lose themselves on their own responsibility. You are not willing to trust them
alone.”</p>

<p>” Well, perhaps you are right.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Come and dine at the hotel. I think Seaborne will be there.”</p>

<p>” No, thank you.”</p>

<p>Mallard had waited but a few minutes in
the court of the Palazzo Borghese next
morning, when Miriam joined him. There
was some constraint on both sides. Miriam
looked as if she did not wish yesterday’s
conversation to be revived in their manner
of meeting. Her ” Good morning, Mr. Mallard,” had as little reference as possible to
the fact of this being an appointment. The
artist was in quite another mood than that
of yesterday ; his smile was formal, and he
seemed indisposed for conversation.</p>

<p>“I have the <i>permesso</i>,” he said, leading
at once to the door of the gallery.</p>

<p>They sauntered about the first room, exchanging a few idle remarks. In the second, a woman past the prime of life was copying a large picture. They looked at her work from a distance, and Miriam asked if it was well done.</p>

<p>“What do you think yourself ?” asked
Mallard.</p>

<p>“It seems to me skilful and accurate, but
I know that perhaps it is neither one nor
the other.”</p>

<p>He pointed out several faults, which she
at once recognized.</p>

<p>“I wonder I could not see them at first.
That confirms me in distrust of myself. I
am as likely as not to admire a thing that
is utterly worthless.”</p>

<p>“As likely as not—no ; at least, I think
not. But of course your eye is untrained,
and you have no real knowledge to go upon.
You can judge an original picture sentimentally, and your sentiment will not be
wholly misleading. You can’t judge a
copy technically, but I think you have
more than average observation. How would
you like to spend your life like this
copyist ?”</p>

<p>“I would give my left hand to have
her skill in my right.”</p>

<p>” You would ?”</p>

<p>“I should be able to <i>do</i> something—something definite and tolerably good.”</p>

<p>” Why, so you can already ; one thing in
particular.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Learn your own deficiencies ; a thing
that most people neither will nor can.
Look at this Francia, and tell me your
thoughts about it.”</p>

<p>She examined the picture for a minute
or two. Then, without moving her eyes,
she murmured :</p>

<p>“I can say nothing that is worth
saying.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Say what you think, or
what you feel.”</p>

<p>“Why should you wish me to talk commonplace ?”</p>

<p>” That is precisely what I don’t wish you
to talk. You know what is commonplace,
and therefore you can avoid it. Never
mind his school or his date. What did the
man want to express here, and how far do
you think he has succeeded ? That’s the main thing; I wish a few critics would
understand it.”</p>

<p>Miriam obeyed him, and said what she
had to say diffidently, but in clear terms.
Mallard was silent when she ceased, and she
looked up at him. He rewarded her with
a smile, and one or two nods—as his
manner was.</p>

<p>“I have not made myself ridiculous ?”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p>They had walked on a little, when Mallard
said to her unexpectedly :</p>

<p>“Please to bear in mind that I make no
claim to infallibility. I am a painter of
landscape ; out of my own sphere, I become
an amateur. You are not bound to accept
my judgment.”</p>

<p>” Of course not,” she replied simply.</p>

<p>“It occurred to me that I had been
rather dictatorial.”</p>

<p>“So you have, Mr. Mallard,” she returned,
looking at a picture.</p>

<p>“I am sorry. It’s the failing of men who
have often to be combative, and who live much in solitude. I will try to use a less
offensive tone.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that your tone was in
the least offensive.”</p>

<p>“A more polite tone, then—as you taught
me yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I had rather you spoke just as is natural
to you.”</p>

<p>Mallard laughed.</p>

<p>“Politeness is not natural to me, I admit.
I am horribly uncomfortable whenever I
have to pick my words out of regard to
polite people. That is why I shun what is
called society. What little I have seen of
it has been more than enough for me.”</p>

<p>“I have seen still less of it ; but I understand your dislike.”</p>

<p>“Before you left home, didn’t you associate a great deal with people ?”</p>

<p>“People of a certain kind,” she replied
coldly. “It was not society as you mean it.”</p>

<p>“You will be glad to mix more freely
with the world, when you are back in
England ?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell. By whom is that Madonna ?
“</p>

<p>Thus they went slowly on, until they
came to the little hall where the fountain
plays, and whence is the outlook over the
Tiber. It was delightful to sit here in the
shadows, made cooler and fresher by that
plashing water, and to see the glorious sunlight gleam upon the river’s tawny flow.</p>

<p>“Each time that I have been in Rome,” said Mallard, “I have felt, after the first few
days, a peculiar mental calm. The other
cities of Italy haven’t the same effect on.
me. Perhaps every one experiences it, more
or less. There comes back to me at moments
the kind of happiness which I knew as a
boy—a freedom from the sense of duties
and responsibilities, of work to be done, and
of disagreeable things to be faced ; the kind
of contentment I used to have when I was
reading lives of artists, or looking at prints
of famous pictures, or myself trying to
draw. It is possible that this mood is not
such a strange one with many people as with me ; when it comes, I feel grateful to
the powers that rule life. Since boyhood,
I have never known it in the north. Out
of Rome, perhaps only in fine weather on
the Mediterranean. But in Rome is its
perfection.”</p>

<p>“I thought you preferred the north,”
said Miriam.</p>

<p>“Because I so often choose to work
there ? I can do better work when I take
subjects in wild scenery and stern climates,
but when my thoughts go out for pleasure,
they choose Italy. I don’t enjoy myself in
the Hebrides or in Norway, but what powers
I have are all brought out there. Here I
am not disposed to work. I want to live,
and I feel that life can be a satisfaction
in itself without labour. I am naturally
the idlest of men. Work is always pain to
me. I like to dream pictures ; but it’s
terrible to drag myself before the blank
canvas.”</p>

<p>Miriam gazed at the Tiber.</p>

<p>“Do these palaces,” he asked, “ever make you wish you owned them ? Did you ever
imagine yourself walking among the marbles
and the pictures with the sense of this being
your home ?”</p>

<p>“I have wondered what that must be.
But I never wished it had fallen to my
lot.”</p>

<p>“No ? You are not ambitious ?”</p>

<p>“Not in that way. To own a palace
such as this would make one insignificant.”</p>

<p>“That is admirably true ! I should give
it away, to recover self-respect. Shakespeare or Michael Angelo might live here
and make it subordinate to him ; I should
be nothing but the owner of the palace.
You like to feel your individuality ?”</p>

<p>“Who does not?”</p>

<p>“In you, I think it is strong.”</p>

<p>Miriam smiled a little, as if she liked the
compliment. Before either spoke again,
other visitors came to look at the view, and
disturbed them.</p>

<p>“I shan’t ask you to come anywhere to-morrow,” said Mallard, when they had again talked for awhile of pictures. ” And the next day Mrs. Elgar will be here.”</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>” That wouldn’t prevent me from going to
a gallery—if you thought of it.”</p>

<p>“You will have much to talk of. And
your stay in Rome won’t be long after that.”</p>

<p>Miriam made no reply.</p>

<p>“I wish your brother had been coming,”
he went on. “I should have liked to hear
from him about the book he is writing.”</p>

<p>“Shall you not be in London before
long ?” she asked, without show of much
interest.</p>

<p>“I think so, but I have absolutely no
plans. Probably it is raining hard in
England, or even snowing. I must enjoy
the sunshine a little longer. I hope your
health won’t suffer from the change of
climate.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” she answered mechanically.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will find you can’t live
there ?”</p>

<p>” What does it matter ? I have no ties.”</p>

<p>” No, you are independent ; that is a
great blessing.”</p>

<p>Chatting as if of indifferent things, they
left the gallery.</p>
