<title>Chapter 7 (Chapter 1 of Vol.2) of Love, The Conqueror by Sydney Carstone</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>
One lovely August day Mrs. Kettering started off, and the juvenile community of
“Erin’s Row” celebrated the glad event by holding an <em>al fresco</em> festival in the field
which lay at the back of their houses. Each family contributed something towards
the entertainment.
</p>
<p>—
The well-to-do Mrs. Burke had munificently supplied the meat for the occasion,
and her five sturdy olive branches appeared on the scene, each furnished with a substantial
packet of cold bacon cut up in thick slices, and enveloped in sheets of the <em>Irish Flag</em>,
which imparted to the bacon a flavour quite as strong as the sentiments enunciated in the paper.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kenny, who kept the huckster’s shop at the corner, had good-naturedly subscribed all her stale,
bilious-looking penny tarts and buns, which, unlike Tommy Moore’s vase, retained the aroma, not of
the roses, but of the tallow candles beside which they had reposed so long. There were also apples,
nuts, gingerbread, and sugar-sticks—in all, a most tempting feast, to which the poor twins could only
contribute some hunches of bread and cheese, which Mrs. Kettering had considered sufficient for them
until her return.
</p>
<p>
The children started off gaily, no presentiment of the coming storm disturbing their minds. Soon the air
was filled with the sound of their merry voices and the missiles which they gathered from a neighbouring
dust-heap and discharged at each other’s head in vigorous mimic warfare.
</p>
<p>
Now and then a mother sauntered out to have “an eye on them,” and see that they got into no special danger
or mischief; and these matrons were almost as pleased as their children with the hearty fun and frolic
which ruled the hour.
</p>
<p>
All went merry as a marriage-bell, and would have ended happily had not some imp of discord put it into
Mrs. Kettering’s head to come back by the three o’clock train instead of the five.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Burke promised the children that she would keep in the spark of fire, which was to save Mrs. Kettering
the trouble of lighting it, on her return, to boil up the tea-kettle.
</p>
<p>
Having done this little neighbourly office, Mrs. Burke lingered and inspected, with curiosity and some
bewilderment, the various culinary articles which hung in a shining row against the wall. She had never
seen such things before, and marvelled greatly as to their use and immaculate brightness.
</p>
<p>
She was leisurely speculating about them, when Mrs. Kettering walked into the cottage, and stood for
a moment in mute surprise. Instead of the two little prim figures which she had always found demurely
seated at their work awaiting her return, she saw an empty room in unwonted disorder—books flung
all over the table, chairs all awry, and the stiff clean pinafores she had put on the children only
that morning lying in a tossed bundle on the floor. The owners of them were nowhere to be seen, and,
to put the climax to her horror and indignation, through the open kitchen door loomed the portly
figure of Mrs. Burke, coolly fingering her household gods. The sound of Mrs. Kettering’s quick
footsteps coming towards her first announced her presence to Mrs. Burke.
</p>
<p>
With a hastily muttered “Glory be to God,” she quickly put back a potato-steamer, which, after much
cogitation, she had pronounced to be a “haythenish coffee-pot,” and, making a polite salute, hoped she
saw Mrs. Kettering “well an hearty.”
</p>
<p>
With native quickness the Irishwoman was prepared to sink the dislike she felt for her neighbor, and
try to blarney her a bit, until she could think of some fiction to account for the twins’ absence.
But when the proprietress of the establishment, instead of returning her greeting, stood glaring at
her in anger and scorn, the blood of the ancient Irish kings rose to the occasion, and their
<em>soi-disant</em> descendant was in nowise disinclined to meet the coming quarrel half-way.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing in my house?” demanded Mrs. Kettering sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Faix, ye may well ax an wondler at me demaning meeself be crossing the dure av a person as hasn’t
the manners av a wild Injun,” replied Mrs. Burke, placing her arms akimbo, and surveying her enemy
with withering contempt. “Another body id say at laste, ‘Thank ye, kindly,’ whin a neighbour tuk the
throuble to kape in her bit av fire, to let her have a cup av tay comfortable whin she cum in.”
</p>
<p>
“I want none of your assistance,” answered Mrs. Kettering tartly. “I left my grandchildren to do what
was necessary. I don’t wish such as you coming about my house.”
</p>
<p>
“Sich as me, indeed,” echoed Mrs. Burke, with a dangerous gleam in her ey. “Be plazed to remember,
Mrs. Kettering, marum, that you’re speakin to yer betters. An O’Dowel av Ballyrooley has no call to be
ashamed before thim as had ancesthors swapin crossins, whin hur own dhrue their coach and fure.”
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! woman, don’t make such a fool of yourself,” exclaimed Mrs. Kettering scornfully. “What do I
care what your ancestors were, or whether you had one ar all or not, as is most likely? I know you
to be a dirty, impudent woman, and if I ever catch you in my house again I’ll give you in charge to
the police.”
</p>
<p>
“Wid ye raly now, pon yer honour, ma’am?” sneered Mrs. Burke. “Musha, it’s polis, an sich like dirty
thricks as becomes the like av ye, ye defamin, cowld-hearted, old skinflint av an Englishwoman, that
haven’t a bit of naythur even fur the poor, blessed, little lambs, that any other woman, barrin her
being a stone an not raysonable flesh an blood, would cotton to an trate like a Christian. Behad,
maybe it’s yerself ‘ll be walked off to the polis some day when ye’re massacreeing the childher av
the dead mother, that’s lookin’ down from Heaven on yer divelment — an the sooner the betther I’m
thinking.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you go?” cried Mrs. Kettering, trembling with rage.
</p>
<p>
“Wid the greatest pleasure in life, ma’am,” replied Mrs. Burke, making a sweeping curtsey. “Thim as
is accustomed to dacency doesn’t find yer company so agreeable as to timpt them to lave their own
comfortable place an stay wid ye. But, maybe, now, as I was short tuk av a night to make a dhrop av
curds an whey, ye’d be so kind as to let me set the mug av milk afore yer face, it id turn it quicker
nor a taste av vinegar any day.”
</p>
<p>
With this remark Mrs. Burke swept past Mrs. Kettering with great dignity and banged the cottage door
loudly after her. Once outside, however, her rage gave place to pity and anxiety for the two helpless
little things who would be exposed to their grandmother’s violence.
</p>
<p>
She hurried in to tell Mrs. Kenny of the catastrophe, and to take counsel as to the best means to
save the children.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kettering, hearing the shouts and peals of laughter which came from the direction of the dust-heap,
rightly guessed that the truants were there, and at once started off to find them. Without a moment’s
delay she swooped down on her prey and bore them off.
</p>
<p>
While Mrs. Burke and Mrs. Kenny still stood in consultation they saw the old woman approaching, dragging
a child along by each hand. Kate, sobbing hysterically in terror of the punishment which lay before
her, and Edith, pale and sullen, with her lips tightly set together to repress all sound of fear.
</p>
<p>
Behind followed the lately joyous band of romping children, now silent and sorrowful, creeping dejectedly
along after the prisoners, whom they were powerless to rescue.
</p>
<p>
The gloomy procession passed the top of “Erin’s Row,” and many of the women came out of their houses to
see what was wrong. One glance explained all, and the sight of the poor little orphans’ sad plight was
too much for the warm-hearted mothers to bear in silence.
</p>
<p>
They faced Mrs. Kettering in a body, and with many opprobrious epithets adjured her to keep her hands
off the children or it would be worse for her.
</p>
<p>
The angry old woman vouchsafed no reply, except to tighten her hold on her grandchildren’s wrists
and drag them along faster.
</p>
<p>
“Lave go av them, or I’ll plant the marks av the tin fingers on ye,” exclaimed one of the women,
standing threateningly before her.
</p>
<p>
“Do ye think we’d stand by an see the childher massecreed by a flint-hearted ould besom like ye?”
ejaculated another.
</p>
<p>
“No, bedad, we’re not haythens nor Sassenachs,” put in Mrs. Burke.
</p>
<p>
“Let the childher alone, or we’ll pull the house down over yer ears.”
</p>
<p>
“Stand out of my way,” cried Mrs. Kettering, scowling at the women, who blocked her path. “I shall do
as I like with my grandchildren. You have no right to interfere; the police will protect me from a
low Irish rabble like you.”
</p>
<p>
“Faix, it’s the like av ye hus always to demane yerself be turnin to the polis.”
</p>
<p>
“Irish rabble, bedad; thanks be to the blessed Virgin an the saints we are Irish, and have some naythur
for the motherless childher.”
</p>
<p>
“It becomes a cowld-hearted Englishwoman like ye to defame her betters.”
</p>
<p>
“What is all this about?” asked a man’s voice; and the voluble tongues suddenly ceased, and the faces
assumed various expressions of disgust as they saw the detested policeman standing behind them.
</p>
<p>
“Disperse this mob,” said Mrs. Kettering sharply; “they are blocking my way and threatening to pull
my house down.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is it all about?” asked the man.
</p>
<p>
“She’d be afther killin the poor childher,” answered one of the women. “Look at their blessed little
faces this minute; shure it ‘ud make the heart av a stature bleed to see thim struck like that wid the
fear av hur.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s shut up breakin stones she ought to be, instead av lavin’ her mark on the dead woman’s orphans,”
remarked another.
</p>
<p>
“You surely don’t mean to beat these little girls?” Said the policeman in a tone of sympathy that
considerably elevated him in the opinion of the bystanders.
</p>
<p>
“Who said I was going to beat them?” asked Mrs. Kettering sharply. “If I consider it necessary I shall
do so; there is no law against it, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“Whin was an English law iver agin dhrivin an batin thim as can’t stand up to ye?” demanded an irate
patriot. “It’s little the law av God throubles ye, or yi’d know He has a double eye on the orphan.”
</p>
<p>
By this time the policeman had piloted Mrs. Kettering to her own door, and the small crowd stood
scowling and muttering behind.
</p>
<p>
“Take my advice and don’t irritate those people by being too hard on the little ones,” said the man
significantly. “I can’t stay here all night to watch you, and these Irish won’t think twice about
doing as they said, once their blood is up.”
</p>
<p>
“If any mischief happens to my house through your negligence, I will report you,” was the gracious
response; and Mrs. Kettering and the children vanished into the house, with a dismal wail of despair
from Kate, which was answered by fierce and pitying ejaculations from the women outside.
</p>
<p>
But, although Mrs. Kettering had shown such a dauntless front, she deemed it wiser not to proceed
to extremities while the excited Irishwomen stood within hearing, and for the present contented herself
with pushing the twins into their room and telling them to get into their bed at once. Delighted at
the thought of escaping with such a slight punishment, they quickly obeyed, and lay, not even daring to
whisper to each other while their grandmother was within earshot.
</p>
<p>
After listening for some time and hearing nothing to justify their interference, the crowd dispersed,
and the policeman walked away, secretly hoping that Mrs. Kettering might meet with her deserts when
his back was turned.
</p>
<p>
They had all been too excited to notice that the manager of the mines and another gentleman had come
up and watched the scene, from a distance.
</p>
<p>
The second gentleman was Mr. Leng’s solicitor, who had before called on Mrs. Kettering, and he at once
recognized her and guessed whose the two girls were.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that old woman?” he asked of the manager.
</p>
<p>
“Her name is Price,” was the reply. “She came here about ten years ago with those children, and if report
speaks truly, she treats them abominably. No one about the place has a good word for her; but I have always
found her a very respectable woman, ready with her rent to the day.”
</p>
<p>
The lawyer made no reply, but he determined to see Mr. Leng on his return to Manchester the next week,
and tell him what he had discovered.
</p>
<p>
As an hour and more passed over without any action on Mrs. Kettering’s part, the twins grew bolder,
and, childlike, had almost forgotten their trouble, when the door opened, and their grandmother came
into the room.
</p>
<p>
One look at her face and the cane in her hand, told her victims what lay before them. Edith started
up, clenching her hands in an impotent rage, while Kate cowered down under the bed-clothes, and
piteously begged for mercy.
</p>
<p>
But then there was neither mercy nor tenderness in Mrs. Kettering’s heart.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you thought you’d got off what you deserved,” she said harshly; “but I’ll teach you not
to deceive and disobey me again. You’ve badness and lying in your blood, both sides; but I’ll cut
it out of you as long as I am able to hold a stick.”
</p>
<p>
With these words, she tore down the bed covering, and dealt a stinging blow to the poor little
quivering body exposed to her fury.
</p>
<p>
The child shrieked wildly with the pain, and Edith, beside herself with fury, sprang like a tigress
at the old woman, striking her on the face, and trying to wrench the stick from her hand. This
resistance only had the effect of making Mrs. Kettering lose any little control she might have had
over herself. Cruelly and sharply the blows, dealt with all her strength, fell thick, one after
the other, on any part of the children’s bodies that came within reach of the stick.
</p>
<p>
Edith heroically flung herself over her weaker sister, to bear the brunt of the punishment, and even her
stoical nature could not prevent her shrieking aloud as the cane came down with a hissing whisk on
her tender flesh.
</p>
<p>
At last it snapped in two, and Mrs. Kettering, quite out of breath with her exertions, flung the broken
ends away and left the room. Edith was covered with weals, and smarting and aching all over; Kate lay
sick and half fainting, making no effort to stir.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely had Mrs. Kettering closed the door, when Edith sprang from the bed and paced quickly up and down
the floor, grinding her teeth, and clutching her hands in a manner horrible to see. She was so excited and
infuriated that she was almost insensible to her physical pain.
</p>
<p>
After a while, she went over to the bed, and laying her hands on her sister’s shoulder, said in a low,
decided tone:
</p>
<p>
“Kate, you must run away to-night. If you had come when I asked you to long ago, she couldn’t have
beaten us like this.”
</p>
<p>
Kate only moaned and shivered at the proposition, she was too utterly prostrated in mind and body to
be capable of any exertion.
</p>
<p>
“I will help you to dress,” continued Edith, “and when it is dark we will go.”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid to go,” whimpered the terrified child. “Oh, Eddy, don’t ask me to. She would be sure to
find us out, and then it would be awful. If she beats me over again, I shall die, I know I shall, I
am so sore.”
</p>
<p>
“If you stay here, she will beat you for ever,” exclaimed Edith, impatiently. “Let us run away, plenty
of people do and are never found out.”
</p>
<p>
“She can find out anything,” replied Kate, who at that time had almost a superstitious dread of her
grandmother. “I can’t go, Eddy, I am too afraid.”
</p>
<p>
Edith tried in vain to instil some of her courage into the timorous little creature. Kate only grew
peevish, and told her sister, that if she really loved her, she would not tease her so; and shortly
the child dropped into a restless sleep, which brought a half oblivion of her suffering.
</p>
<p>
Very steadily and determinately Edith carried out her purpose. She dressed herself quietly, and sat
still until her grandmother had gone to her bed; then she stood up and drew a long breath. Her face
was frightfully stern, for a child like her, as she unfastened the window. It was a latticed one,
and offered no obstacle to her escape. Before she stepped out, she bent over her unconscious sister
and kissed her; for a moment her resolution wavered, the corners of her mouth twitched convulsively
and hot tears reached to her eyes; but she conquered her passing weakness, and turned her back to the
bed. Without casting a second look behind her, she stepped out of the window, and, after carefully
closing it after her, hastened away.
</p>
<p>
When Mrs. Kettering discovered Edith’s flight, she would gladly have prevented it being known, but
Kate’s grief rendered her for once forgetful of her fear of the old woman, and she disclosed all.
When the child awoke next morning and realised that her sister was indeed gone, she rushed out of
the cottage wildly, to see if she could find her anywhere; and before Mrs. Kettering knew herself
what had happened, the neighbours were in full possession of the facts from the weeping and forlorn
child.
</p>
<p>
They sent out in all directions to try and find traces of the missing girl, and in a few hours some
of the seekers came back looking very excited and awe-struck, bringing Edith’s straw hat, which they
had found lying beside the river.
</p>
<p>
At the sight of it the crowd burst into wailings and angry execrations against the unnatural old
woman, whose cruelty they were certain had driven the child to desperation, and caused her to drown
herself.
</p>
<p>
The affair now became very serious. The police interrogated Mrs. Kettering, who, instead of expressing
compunction for what had occurred, grew harder and more defiant, saying that it was no fault of hers
if the girl’s devilment had led her to destroy herself; that she had only done her duty in punishing
her for disobedience and deceit; and that such a depraved creature was better out of the world that
in it.
</p>
<p>
The river was dragged without any result; but that gave no hope, for the current was strong, and the
body could easily have been carried out of reach before it was sought for.
</p>
<p>
None thought of work or pursuing their ordinary avocations in “Erin’s Row” that day. The women assembled
in stormy groups, and when the men came home, they were not less loud in their wrath against Mrs.
Kettering; and to prevent a disturbance, it was found necessary to place several police round the
old woman’s cottage.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, Mr. Maxwell, the curate, called to learn the truth of the many reports he had heard,
and found Mrs. Kettering seated as usual at her sewing, showing no signs of emotion, except that her
face was paler, and, if possible, more forbidding than ever in its harsh expression.
</p>
<p>
Poor little Kate sat in the far corner of the room, with her lesson books before her, but to stupefied
by crying to make even a pretence of using them.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kettering received her visitor with repelling coldness, letting him see plainly that she neither
desired his presence, nor intended to submit herself to his advice.
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Maxwell was never deterred from doing his duty by its being made unpleasant to him, and he went
to the point at once. “This is a very sad story I hear, Mrs. Price,” he said gravely; “I hope for your
sake, I have been misinformed.”
</p>
<p>
“As likely as not that you have,” was the tart reply, “if you have nothing better to do than to go
through the parish, listening to gossiping tongues.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it true that one of the poor little girls drowned herself?” asked the curate sternly.
</p>
<p>
“I daresay you know as much about it as I do,” replied Mrs. Kettering, threading her needle with an
air of indifference. “She was a thoroughly depraved girl, and might as well go to hell that way as
any other.”
</p>
<p>
At this allusion to her sister’s dreadful fate, Kate burst out into bitter tears and sobs.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t cry so, my child,” said Mr. Maxwell, going over to her and trying to soothe her; “if your poor
sister is dead, she has gone before a merciful Saviour, who loves little children and will make allowances
for all she had to suffer.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve brought my grandchildren up on sound Gospel truths,” cried Mrs. Kettering angrily. “And it’s set
down there plain enough that those who die in their sins go straight to hell, and burn for ever. I don’t
think it a clergyman’s duty to teach new-fangled, false doctrine.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a clergyman’s duty to warn you that your bitter, cruel conduct will bring a heavy judgment from
God on you,” said Mr. Maxwell sternly. “If your ill-treatment drove that poor, half-maddened child
to destroy herself, it’s you who are guilty of her blood.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think I’ll trouble about that; I know what’s my duty. I did it, and would do it over again.
I’m no ignorant woman to swallow the unscriptural rubbish you want to cram down my throat.”
</p>
<p>
“You must read your Bible very strangely, if you can’t see that love and forbearance are insisted
upon as the first of Christian duties.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a good hot hell and a good honest devil insisted upon—very strongly, too, in the Bible; and,
by the way you gloss them over in your sermons, I’m thinking your eyes want opening to the truth more
than mine do, parson though you are.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a dreadful woman,” exclaimed Mr. Maxwell, greatly shocked.
</p>
<p>
“I’m a sound Christian,” replied Mrs. Kettering coolly. “I’ve always sat under Gospel preachers, and
I’ll scourge any child I have to rear within an inch of its life if I consider I can save its soul
by doing it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Maxwell looked at the old Pharisee in horror. Her self-satisfaction and blindness to her state
were to him awful.
</p>
<p>
“I pray God to soften your heart and give you a true understanding of His Word,” he said, after a
pause. “In the meanwhile I shall try to take means to save your remaining grandchild from your
unnatural severity. She must be protected.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Maxwell had not time to carry out his intention of rescuing Kate. Two days later Mrs. Kettering
disappeared, taking the child with her. The Irishwomen kept their word, and made the place too hot
to hold her.
</p>
<p>
The police could not keep guard before her cottage for ever, and perhaps had little desire to save
her from the punishment she so richly deserved.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the men were out of sight, their place was taken by the indignant neighbours, who relieved
each other in keeping Mrs. Kettering within range of their observation. They hooted and jeered, and
hurled missiles and opprobrious epithets at the old woman whenever she ventured to show herself at
door or window.
</p>
<p>
Once the sturdy old creature defiantly walked out into her garden to pull some lettuce. This was an
occasion which her enemies had hoped for and provided for. A brisk shower of rotten eggs, cabbage-stalks,
and mud descended upon her with such good aim, that, blinded and infuriated, she had to beat a hasty
and undignified retreat amidst the triumphant jeers of her persecutors.
</p>
<p>
The next morning the cottage was empty, and during the day a man from the town carried off all Mrs.
Kettering’s belongings, and Moorfield knew her no more.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Leng’s solicitor came armed with fresh proposals from that gentleman, he could gain no
information of those he sought, and could take no further steps about tracing them until he consulted
his client.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Leng showed no inclination to have the matter followed up. He was just then suffering the severe
punishment for his fault inflicted upon him by his wife and mother-in-law, and was anything but desirous
to run the risk of more details coming to the ears of his womankind. He satisfied his elastic conscience
with his faint attempt to do his duty, and was considerably relieved when he learned that Mrs. Kettering
had again taken his children out of his reach.
