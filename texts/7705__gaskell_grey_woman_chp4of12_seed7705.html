<p>(Extract from a Letter from Richard Whittingham, Esq.</p>
<hr><!-- Decorative break between title and text in original -->

<p>You were formerly so much amused at my pride in my
descent from that sister of Calvin’s, who married a
Whittingham, Dean of Durham, that I doubt if you will
be able to enter into the regard for my distinguished
relation that has led me to France, in order to examine
registers and archives, which, I thought, might enable
me to discover collateral descendants of the great
reformer, with whom I might call cousins. I shall
not tell you of my troubles and adventures in this
research; you are not worthy to hear of them; but
something so curious befel me one evening last August,
that if I had not been perfectly certain I was wide
awake, I might have taken it for a dream.</p>

<p>For the purpose I have named, it was necessary that
I should make Tours my head-quarters for a time. I
had traced descendants of the Calvin family out of
Normandy into the centre of France; but I found it
was necessary to have a kind of permission from the
bishop of the diocese before I could see certain family
papers, which had fallen into the possession of the
Church; and, as I had several English friends at Tours,
I awaited the answer to my request to Monseigneur
de —―, at that town. I was ready to accept any
invitation; but I received very few; and was sometimes
a little at a loss what to do with my evenings. The
<i>table d’hôte</i> was at five o’clock; I did not wish to go
to the expense of a private sitting-room, disliked the
dinnery atmosphere of the <i>salle à manger</i>, could not
play either at pool or billiards, and the aspect of my
fellow guests was unprepossessing enough to make me
unwilling to enter into any <i>tête-à-tête</i> gamblings with
them. So I usually rose from table early, and tried to
make the most of the remaining light of the August
evenings in walking briskly off to explore the surrounding
country; the middle of the day was too hot for this
purpose, and better employed in lounging on a bench in
the Boulevards, lazily listening to the distant band, and
noticing with equal laziness the faces and figures of the
women who passed by.</p>

<p>One Thursday evening, the 18th of August it was,
I think, I had gone further than usual in my walk, and
I found that it was later than I had imagined when I
paused to turn back. I fancied I could make a round;
I had enough notion of the direction in which I was, to
see that by turning up a narrow straight lane to my left
I should shorten my way back to Tours. And so I
believe I should have done, could I have found an outlet
at the right place, but field-paths are almost unknown in
that part of France, and my lane, stiff and straight as
any street, and marked into terribly vanishing perspective
by the regular row of poplars on each side,
seemed interminable. Of course night came on, and I
was in darkness. In England I might have had a chance
of seeing a light in some cottage only a field or two off,
and asking my way from the inhabitants; but here I
could see no such welcome sight; indeed, I believe
French peasants go to bed with the summer daylight,
so if there were any habitations in the neighbourhood I
never saw them. At last—I believe I must have walked
two hours in the darkness,—I saw the dusky outline of
a wood on one side of the weariful lane, and, impatiently
careless of all forest laws and penalties for trespassers, I
made my way to it, thinking that if the worst came to
the worst, I could find some covert—some shelter where
I could lie down and rest, until the morning light gave
me a chance of finding my way back to Tours. But the
plantation, on the outskirts of what appeared to me a
dense wood, was of young trees, too closely planted to
be more than slender stems growing up to a good height,
with scanty foliage on their summits. On I went towards
the thicker forest, and once there I slackened my pace,
and began to look about me for a good lair. I was as
dainty as Lochiel’s grandchild, who made his grandsire
indignant at the luxury of his pillow of snow: this brake
was too full of brambles, that felt damp with dew; there
was no hurry, since I had given up all hope of passing
the night between four walls; and I went leisurely
groping about, and trusting that there were no wolves
to be poked up out of their summer drowsiness by my
stick, when all at once I saw a château before me, not a
quarter of a mile off, at the end of what seemed to be an
ancient avenue (now overgrown and irregular), which I
happened to be crossing, when I looked to my right, and
saw the welcome sight. Large, stately, and dark was
its outline against the dusky night-sky; there were
pepper-boxes and tourelles and what-not fantastically
going up into the dim starlight. And more to the
purpose still, though I could not see the details of the
building that I was now facing, it was plain enough
that there were lights in many windows, as if some
great entertainment was going on.</p>

<p>“They are hospitable people, at any rate,” thought I.
“Perhaps they will give me a bed. I don’t suppose
French propriétaires have traps and horses quite as
plentiful as English gentlemen; but they are evidently
having a large party, and some of their guests may be
from Tours, and will give me a cast back to the Lion
d’Or. I am not proud, and I am dog-tired. I am not
above hanging on behind, if need be.”</p>

<p>So, putting a little briskness and spirit into my walk,
I went up to the door, which was standing open, most
hospitably, and showing a large lighted hall, all hung
round with spoils of the chase, armour, &c., the details
of which I had not time to notice, for the instant I stood
on the threshold a huge porter appeared, in a strange,
old-fashioned dress, a kind of livery which well befitted
the general appearance of the house. He asked me, in
French (so curiously pronounced that I thought I had
hit upon a new kind of <i>patois</i>), my name, and whence I
came. I thought he would not be much the wiser, still
it was but civil to give it before I made my request for
assistance; so, in reply, I said—</p>

<p>“My name is Whittingham—Richard Whittingham,
an English gentleman, staying at—―.” To my infinite
surprise, a light of pleased intelligence came over the
giant’s face; he made me a low bow, and said (still in
the same curious dialect) that I was welcome, that I was
long expected.</p>

<p>“Long expected!” What could the fellow mean?
Had I stumbled on a nest of relations by John Calvin’s
side, who had heard of my genealogical inquiries, and
were gratified and interested by them? But I was too
much pleased to be under shelter for the night to think
it necessary to account for my agreeable reception before
I enjoyed it. Just as he was opening the great heavy
<i>battants</i> of the door that led from the hall to the interior,
he turned round and said,—</p>

<p>“Apparently Monsieur le Géanquilleur is not come
with you.”</p>

<p>“No! I am all alone; I have lost my way,”—and I
was going on with my explanation, when he, as if quite
indifferent to it, led the way up a great stone staircase,
as wide as many rooms, and having on each landing-place
massive iron wickets, in a heavy framework; these
the porter unlocked with the solemn slowness of age.
Indeed, a strange, mysterious awe of the centuries that
had passed away since this château was built, came over
me as I waited for the turning of the ponderous keys in
the ancient locks. I could almost have fancied that I
heard a mighty rushing murmur (like the ceaseless sound
of a distant sea, ebbing and flowing for ever and for
ever), coming forth from the great vacant galleries that
opened out on each side of the broad staircase, and were
to be dimly perceived in the darkness above us. It was
as if the voices of generations of men yet echoed and
eddied in the silent air. It was strange, too, that my
friend the porter going before me, ponderously infirm,
with his feeble old hands striving in vain to keep the
tall flambeau he held steadily before him,—strange, I
say, that he was the only domestic I saw in the vast
halls and passages, or met with on the grand staircase.
At length we stood before the gilded doors that led into
the saloon where the family—or it might be the company,
so great was the buzz of voices—was assembled.
I would have remonstrated when I found he was going
to introduce me, dusty and travel-smeared, in a morning
costume that was not even my best, into this grand <i>salon</i>,
with nobody knew how many ladies and gentlemen assembled;
but the obstinate old man was evidently bent
upon taking me straight to his master, and paid no heed
to my words.</p>

<p>The doors flew open, and I was ushered into a saloon
curiously full of pale light, which did not culminate on
any spot, nor proceed from any centre, nor flicker with
any motion of the air, but filled every nook and corner,
making all things deliciously distinct; different from
our light of gas or candle, as is the difference between
a clear southern atmosphere and that of our misty
England.</p>

<p>At the first moment, my arrival excited no attention,
the apartment was so full of people, all intent on their
own conversation. But my friend the porter went up to
a handsome lady of middle age, richly attired in that
antique manner which fashion has brought round again
of late years, and, waiting first in an attitude of deep
respect till her attention fell upon him, told her my
name and something about me, as far as I could guess
from the gestures of the one and the sudden glance of
the eye of the other.</p>

<p>She immediately came towards me with the most
friendly actions of greeting, even before she had advanced
near enough to speak. Then,—and was it not strange?—her
words and accent were that of the commonest
peasant of the country. Yet she herself looked high-bred,
and would have been dignified had she been a
shade less restless, had her countenance worn a little
less lively and inquisitive expression. I had been
poking a good deal about the old parts of Tours, and
had had to understand the dialect of the people who
dwelt in the Marché au Vendredi and similar places,
or I really should not have understood my handsome
hostess, as she offered to present me to her husband, a
henpecked, gentlemanly man, who was more quaintly
attired than she in the very extreme of that style of
dress. I thought to myself that in France, as in England,
it is the provincials who carry fashion to such an
excess as to become ridiculous.</p>

<p>However, he spoke (still in the <i>patois</i>) of his pleasure
in making my acquaintance, and led me to a strange
uneasy easy-chair, much of a piece with the rest of the
furniture, which might have taken its place without any
anachronism by the side of that in the Hôtel Cluny.
Then again began the clatter of French voices, which
my arrival had for an instant interrupted, and I had
leisure to look about me. Opposite to me sat a very
sweet-looking lady, who must have been a great beauty
in her youth, I should think, and would be charming in
old age, from the sweetness of her countenance. She
was, however, extremely fat, and on seeing her feet laid
up before her on a cushion, I at once perceived that
they were so swollen as to render her incapable of walking,
which probably brought on her excessive <i>embonpoint</i>.
Her hands were plump and small, but rather coarse-grained
in texture, not quite so clean as they might have
been, and altogether not so aristocratic-looking as the
charming face. Her dress was of superb black velvet,
ermine-trimmed, with diamonds thrown all abroad
over it.</p>

<p>Not far from her stood the least little man I had ever
seen; of such admirable proportions no one could call
him a dwarf, because with that word we usually associate
something of deformity; but yet with an elfin look
of shrewd, hard, worldly wisdom in his face that marred
the impression which his delicate regular little features
would otherwise have conveyed. Indeed, I do not think
he was quite of equal rank with the rest of the company,
for his dress was inappropriate to the occasion (and he
apparently was an invited, while I was an involuntary
guest); and one or two of his gestures and actions were
more like the tricks of an uneducated rustic than anything
else. To explain what I mean: his boots had
evidently seen much service, and had been re-topped,
re-heeled, re-soled to the extent of cobbler’s powers.
Why should he have come in them if they were not his
best—his only pair? And what can be more ungenteel
than poverty? Then again he had an uneasy trick of
putting his hand up to his throat, as if he expected to
find something the matter with it; and he had the
awkward habit—which I do not think he could have
copied from Dr. Johnson, because most probably he
had never heard of him—of trying always to retrace
his steps on the exact boards on which he had trodden
to arrive at any particular part of the room. Besides,
to settle the question, I once heard him addressed as
Monsieur Poucet, without any aristocratic “de” for a
prefix; and nearly every one else in the room was a
marquis, at any rate.</p>

<p>I say, “nearly every one;” for some strange people
had the entrée; unless, indeed, they were, like me,
benighted. One of the guests I should have taken for
a servant, but for the extraordinary influence he seemed
to have over the man I took for his master, and who
never did anything without, apparently, being urged
thereto by this follower. The master, magnificently
dressed, but ill at ease in his clothes, as if they had
been made for some one else, was a weak-looking, handsome
man, continually sauntering about, and I almost
guessed an object of suspicion to some of the gentlemen
present, which, perhaps, drove him on the companionship
of his follower, who was dressed something in the
style of an ambassador’s chasseur; yet it was not a
chasseur’s dress after all; it was something more
thoroughly old-world; boots half way up his ridiculously
small legs, which clattered as he walked along, as if
they were too large for his little feet; and a great
quantity of grey fur, as trimming to coat, court-mantle,
boots, cap—everything. You know the way in which
certain countenances remind you perpetually of some
animal, be it bird or beast! Well, this chasseur (as I
will call him for want of a better name) was exceedingly
like the great Tom-cat that you have seen so often in
my chambers, and laughed at almost as often for his
uncanny gravity of demeanour. Grey whiskers has my
Tom—grey whiskers had the chasseur: grey hair overshadows
the upper lip of my Tom—grey mustachios hid
that of the chasseur. The pupils of Tom’s eyes dilate
and contract as I had thought cats’ pupils only could do,
until I saw those of the chasseur. To be sure, canny
as Tom is, the chasseur had the advantage in the more
intelligent expression. He seemed to have obtained
most complete sway over his master or patron, whose
looks he watched, and whose steps he followed, with a
kind of distrustful interest that puzzled me greatly.</p>

<p>There were several other groups in the more distant
part of the saloon, all of the stately old school, all
grand and noble, I conjectured from their bearing.
They seemed perfectly well acquainted with each other,
as if they were in the habit of meeting. But I was
interrupted in my observations by the tiny little gentleman
on the opposite side of the room coming across to
take a place beside me. It is no difficult matter to a
Frenchman to slide into conversation, and so gracefully
did my pigmy friend keep up the character of the nation,
that we were almost confidential before ten minutes had
elapsed.</p>

<p>Now I was quite aware that the welcome which all
had extended to me, from the porter up to the vivacious
lady and meek lord of the castle, was intended for some
other person. But it required either a degree of moral
courage, of which I cannot boast, or the self-reliance
and conversational powers of a bolder and cleverer man
than I, to undeceive people who had fallen into so fortunate
a mistake for me. Yet the little man by my
side insinuated himself so much into my confidence,
that I had half a mind to tell him of my exact situation,
and to turn him into a friend and an ally.</p>

<p>“Madame is perceptibly growing older,” said he, in
the midst of my perplexity, glancing at our hostess.</p>

<p>“Madame is still a very fine woman,” replied I.</p>

<p>“Now, is it not strange,” continued he, lowering his
voice, “how women almost invariably praise the absent,
or departed, as if they were angels of light, while as for
the present, or the living”—here he shrugged up his
little shoulders, and made an expressive pause. “Would
you believe it! Madame is always praising her late
husband to monsieur’s face; till, in fact, we guests are
quite perplexed how to look: for, you know, the late
M. de Retz’s character was quite notorious,—everybody
has heard of him.” All the world of Touraine, thought
I, but I made an assenting noise.</p>

<p>At this instant, monsieur our host came up to me, and
with a civil look of tender interest (such as some people
put on when they inquire after your mother, about whom
they do not care one straw), asked if I had heard lately
how my cat was? “How my cat was!” What could
the man mean? My cat! Could he mean the tailless
Tom, born in the Isle of Man, and now supposed to be
keeping guard against the incursions of rats and mice
into my chambers in London? Tom is, as you know,
on pretty good terms with some of my friends, using
their legs for rubbing-posts without scruple, and highly
esteemed by them for his gravity of demeanour, and
wise manner of winking his eyes. But could his fame
have reached across the Channel? However, an answer
must be returned to the inquiry, as monsieur’s face was
bent down to mine with a look of polite anxiety; so I,
in my turn, assumed an expression of gratitude, and
assured him that, to the best of my belief, my cat was
in remarkably good health.</p>

<p>“And the climate agrees with her?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said I, in a maze of wonder at this deep
solicitude in a tailless cat who had lost one foot and half
an ear in some cruel trap. My host smiled a sweet
smile, and, addressing a few words to my little neighbour,
passed on.</p>

<p>“How wearisome those aristocrats are!” quoth my
neighbour, with a slight sneer. “Monsieur’s conversation
rarely extends to more than two sentences to any
one. By that time his faculties are exhausted, and he
needs the refreshment of silence. You and I, monsieur,
are, at any rate, indebted to our own wits for our rise
in the world!”</p>

<p>Here again I was bewildered! As you know, I am
rather proud of my descent from families which, if not
noble themselves, are allied to nobility,—and as to my
“rise in the world”—if I had risen, it would have been
rather for balloon-like qualities than for mother-wit, to
being unencumbered with heavy ballast either in my head
or my pockets. However, it was my cue to agree: so I
smiled again.</p>

<p>“For my part,” said he, “if a man does not stick at
trifles, if he knows how to judiciously add to, or withhold
facts, and is not sentimental in his parade of humanity,
he is sure to do well; sure to affix a <i>de</i> or <i>von</i> to
his name, and end his days in comfort. There is an
example of what I am saying”—and he glanced furtively
at the weak-looking master of the sharp, intelligent
servant, whom I have called the chasseur.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Marquis would never have been anything
but a miller’s son, if it had not been for the talents of
his servant. Of course you know his antecedents?”</p>

<p>I was going to make some remarks on the changes in
the order of the peerage since the days of Louis XVI.—going,
in fact, to be very sensible and historical—when
there was a slight commotion among the people at
the other end of the room. Lacqueys in quaint liveries
must have come in from behind the tapestry, I suppose
(for I never saw them enter, though I sate right opposite
to the doors), and were handing about the slight beverages
and slighter viands which are considered sufficient
refreshments, but which looked rather meagre to my
hungry appetite. These footmen were standing solemnly
opposite to a lady,—beautiful, splendid as the dawn, but—sound
asleep in a magnificent settee. A gentleman
who showed so much irritation at her ill-timed slumbers,
that I think he must have been her husband, was trying
to awaken her with actions not far removed from
shakings. All in vain; she was quite unconscious of his
annoyance, or the smiles of the company, or the automatic
solemnity of the waiting footman, or the perplexed anxiety
of monsieur and madame.</p>

<p>My little friend sat down with a sneer, as if his
curiosity was quenched in contempt.</p>

<p>“Moralists would make an infinity of wise remarks
on that scene,” said he. “In the first place, note the
ridiculous position into which their superstitious reverence
for rank and title puts all these people. Because
monsieur is a reigning prince over some minute principality,
the exact situation of which no one has as yet
discovered, no one must venture to take their glass of
eau sucré till Madame la Princesse awakens; and,
judging from past experience, those poor lacqueys may
have to stand for a century before that happens. Next—always
speaking as a moralist, you will observe—note
how difficult it is to break off bad habits acquired in
youth!”</p>

<p>Just then the prince succeeded, by what means I did
not see, in awaking the beautiful sleeper. But at first
she did not remember where she was, and looking up at
her husband with loving eyes, she smiled and said:</p>

<p>“Is it you, my prince?”</p>

<p>But he was too conscious of the suppressed amusement
of the spectators and his own consequent annoyance,
to be reciprocally tender, and turned away with
some little French expression, best rendered into English
by “Pooh, pooh, my dear!”</p>

<p>After I had had a glass of delicious wine of some
unknown quality, my courage was in rather better plight
than before, and I told my cynical little neighbour—whom
I must say I was beginning to dislike—that I had
lost my way in the wood, and had arrived at the château
quite by mistake.</p>

<p>He seemed mightily amused at my story; said that
the same thing had happened to himself more than
once; and told me that I had better luck than he had
on one of these occasions, when, from his account, he
must have been in considerable danger of his life. He
ended his story by making me admire his boots, which
he said he still wore, patched though they were, and all
their excellent quality lost by patching, because they
were of such a first-rate make for long pedestrian excursions.
“Though, indeed,” he wound up by saying,
“the new fashion of railroads would seem to supersede
the necessity for this description of boots.”</p>

<p>When I consulted him as to whether I ought to make
myself known to my host and hostess as a benighted
traveller, instead of the guest whom they had taken
me for, he exclaimed, “By no means! I hate such
squeamish morality.” And he seemed much offended
by my innocent question, as if it seemed by implication
to condemn something in himself. He was offended and
silent; and just at this moment I caught the sweet,
attractive eyes of the lady opposite—that lady whom I
named at first as being no longer in the bloom of youth,
but as being somewhat infirm about the feet, which were
supported on a raised cushion before her. Her looks
seemed to say, “Come here, and let us have some conversation
together;” and, with a bow of silent excuse to
my little companion, I went across to the lame old lady.
She acknowledged my coming with the prettiest gesture
of thanks possible; and, half apologetically, said, “It
is a little dull to be unable to move about on such evenings
as this; but it is a just punishment to me for my
early vanities. My poor feet, that were by nature so
small, are now taking their revenge for my cruelty in
forcing them into such little slippers….
Besides, monsieur,” with a pleasant smile, “I thought
it was possible you might be weary of the malicious
sayings of your little neighbour. He has not borne the
best character in his youth, and such men are sure to
be cynical in their old age.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked I, with English abruptness.</p>

<p>“His name is Poucet, and his father was, I believe,
a wood-cutter, or charcoal burner, or something of the
sort. They do tell sad stories of connivance at murder,
ingratitude, and obtaining money on false pretences—but
you will think me as bad as he if I go on with my
slanders. Rather let us admire the lovely lady coming
up towards us, with the roses in her hand—I never see
her without roses, they are so closely connected with her
past history, as you are doubtless aware. Ah, beauty!”
said my companion to the lady drawing near to us, “it
is like you to come to me, now that I can no longer
go to you.” Then turning to me, and gracefully drawing
me into the conversation, she said, “You must
know that, although we never met until we were both
married, we have been almost like sisters ever since.
There have been so many points of resemblance in our
circumstances, and I think I may say in our characters.
We had each two elder sisters—mine were but half-sisters,
though—who were not so kind to us as they
might have been.”</p>

<p>“But have been sorry for it since,” put in the other
lady.</p>

<p>“Since we have married princes,” continued the same
lady, with an arch smile that had nothing of unkindness
in it, “for we both have married far above our original
stations in life; we are both unpunctual in our habits,
and, in consequence of this failing of ours, we have both
had to suffer mortification and pain.”</p>

<p>“And both are charming,” said a whisper close
behind me. “My lord the marquis, say it—say, ‘And
both are charming.’”</p>

<p>“And both are charming,” was spoken aloud by
another voice. I turned, and saw the wily cat-like chasseur,
prompting his master to make civil speeches.</p>

<p>The ladies bowed with that kind of haughty acknowledgment
which shows that compliments from such a
source are distasteful. But our trio of conversation
was broken up, and I was sorry for it. The marquis
lnoked<!-- mistype of looked in original -->as if he had been stirred up to make that one
speech, and hoped that he would not be expected to
say more; while behind him stood the chasseur,
half impertinent and half servile in his ways and
attitudes. The ladies, who were real ladies, seemed
to be sorry for the awkwardness of the marquis, and
addressed some trifling questions to him, adapting
themselves to the subjects on which he could have no
trouble in answering. The chasseur, meanwhile, was
talking to himself in a growling tone of voice. I had
fallen a little into the background at this interruption in
a conversation which promised to be so pleasant, and I
could not help hearing his words.</p>

<p>“Really, De Carabas grows more stupid every day.
I have a great mind to throw off his boots, and leave
him to his fate. I was intended for a court, and to
a court I will go, and make my own fortune as I
have made his. The emperor will appreciate my
talents.”</p>

<p>And such are the habits of the French, or such his
forgetfulness of good manners in his anger, that he spat
right and left on the parquetted floor.</p>

<p>Just then a very ugly, very pleasant-looking man,
came towards the two ladies to whom I had lately been
speaking, leading up to them a delicate, fair woman,
dressed all in the softest white, as if she were <i>vouée au
blanc</i>. I do not think there was a bit of colour about
her. I thought I heard her making, as she came along,
a little noise of pleasure, not exactly like the singing of
a tea-kettle, nor yet like the cooing of a dove, but
reminding me of each sound.</p>

<p>“Madame de Mioumiou was anxious to see you,”
said he, addressing the lady with the roses, “so I have
brought her across to give you a pleasure!” What an
honest, good face! but oh! how ugly! And yet I liked
his ugliness better than most persons’ beauty. There
was a look of pathetic acknowledgment of his ugliness,
and a deprecation of your too hasty judgment, in his
countenance that was positively winning. The soft,
white lady kept glancing at my neighbour the chasseur,
as if they had had some former acquaintance, which
puzzled me very much, as they were of such different
rank. However, their nerves were evidently strung to
the same tune, for at a sound behind the tapestry, which
was more like the scuttering of rats and mice than anything
else, both Madame de Mioumiou and the chasseur
started with the most eager look of anxiety on their
countenances, and by their restless movements—madame’s
panting, and the fiery dilation of his eyes—one
might see that commonplace sounds affected
them both in a manner very different to the rest of
the company. The ugly husband of the lovely lady
with the roses now addressed himself to me.</p>

<p>“We are much disappointed,” he said, “in finding
that monsieur is not accompanied by his countryman—le
grand Jean d’Angleterre; I cannot pronounce his
name rightly”—and he looked at me to help him out.</p>

<p>“Le grand Jean d’Angleterre!” now who was le grand
Jean d’Angleterre? John Bull? John Russell? John
Bright?</p>

<p>“Jean—Jean”—continued the gentleman, seeing my
embarrassment. “Ah, these terrible English names—’Jean
de Géanquilleur!’”</p>

<p>I was as wise as ever. And yet the name struck me
as familiar, but slightly disguised. I repeated it to
myself. It was mighty like John the Giant-killer, only
his friends always call that worthy “Jack.” I said the
name aloud.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is it!” said he. “But why has he not
accompanied you to our little reunion to-night?”</p>

<p>I had been rather puzzled once or twice before, but
this serious question added considerably to my perplexity.
Jack the Giant-killer had once, it is true,
been rather an intimate friend of mine, as far as
(printer’s) ink and paper can keep up a friendship, but
I had not heard his name mentioned for years; and
for aught I knew he lay enchanted with King Arthur’s
knights, who lie entranced until the blast of the trumpets
of four mighty kings shall call them to help at
England’s need. But the question had been asked in
serious earnest by that gentleman, whom I more wished
to think well of me than I did any other person in the
room. So I answered respectfully that it was long since
I had heard anything of my countryman; but that I was
sure it would have given him as much pleasure as it
was doing myself to have been present at such an agreeable
gathering of friends. He bowed, and then the lame
lady took up the word.</p>

<p>“To-night is the night when, of all the year, this
great old forest surrounding the castle is said to be
haunted by the phantom of a little peasant girl who
once lived hereabouts; the tradition is that she was
devoured by a wolf. In former days I have seen her
on this night out of yonder window at the end of the
gallery. Will you, ma belle, take monsieur to see the
view outside by the moonlight (you may possibly see
the phantom-child); and leave me to a little <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with your husband?”</p>

<p>With a gentle movement the lady with the roses complied
with the other’s request, and we went to a great
window, looking down on the forest, in which I had lost
my way. The tops of the far-spreading and leafy trees
lay motionless beneath us in that pale, wan light, which
shows objects almost as distinct in form, though not in
colour, as by day. We looked down on the countless
avenues, which seemed to converge from all quarters
to the great old castle; and suddenly across one, quite
near to us, there passed the figure of a little girl, with
the “capuchon” on, that takes the place of a peasant
girl’s bonnet in France. She had a basket on one arm,
and by her, on the side to which her head was turned,
there went a wolf. I could almost have said it was
licking her hand, as if in penitent love, if either penitence
or love had ever been a quality of wolves,—but
though not of living, perhaps it may be of phantom
wolves.</p>

<p>“There, we have seen her!” exclaimed my beautiful
companion. “Though so long dead, her simple story
of household goodness and trustful simplicity still lingers
in the hearts of all who have ever heard of her; and
the country-people about here say that seeing that
phantom-child on this anniversary brings good luck for
the year. Let us hope that we shall share in the traditionary
good fortune. Ah! here is Madame de Retz—she
retains the name of her first husband, you know, as
he was of higher rank than the present.” We were
joined by our hostess.</p>

<p>“If monsieur is fond of the beauties of nature and
art,” said she, perceiving that I had been looking at
the view from the great window, “he will perhaps take
pleasure in seeing the picture.” Here she sighed, with
a little affectation of grief. “You know the picture I
allude to,” addressing my companion, who bowed assent,
and smiled a little maliciously, as I followed the lead of
madame.</p>

<p>I went after her to the other end of the saloon, noting
by the way with what keen curiosity she caught up what
was passing either in word or action on each side of her.
When we stood opposite to the end wall, I perceived a
full-length picture of a handsome, peculiar-looking man,
with—in spite of his good looks—a very fierce and
scowling expression. My hostess clasped her hands
together as her arms hung down in front, and sighed
once more. Then, half in soliloquy, she said—</p>

<p>“He was the love of my youth; his stern yet manly
character first touched this heart of mine. When—when
shall I cease to deplore his loss!”</p>

<p>Not being acquainted with her enough to answer this
question (if, indeed, it were not sufficiently answered by
the fact of her second marriage), I felt awkward; and,
by way of saying something, I remarked,—</p>

<p>“The countenance strikes me as resembling something
I have seen before—in an engraving from an
historical picture, I think; only, it is there the principal
figure in a group: he is holding a lady by her
hair, and threatening her with his scimitar, while two
cavaliers are rushing up the stairs, apparently only just
in time to save her life.”</p>

<p>“Alas, alas!” said she, “you too accurately describe
a miserable passage in my life, which has often been
represented in a false light. The best of husbands”—here
she sobbed, and became slightly inarticulate with
her grief—”will sometimes be displeased. I was young
and curious, he was justly angry with my disobedience—my
brothers were too hasty—the consequence is, I
became a widow!”</p>

<p>After due respect for her tears, I ventured to suggest
some commonplace consolation. She turned round
sharply:—</p>

<p>“No, monsieur: my only comfort is that I have
never forgiven the brothers who interfered so cruelly,
in such an uncalled-for manner, between my dear husband
and myself. To quote my friend Monsieur Sganarelle—’Ce
sont petites choses qui sont de temps en
temps necessaires dans l’amitié; et cinq ou six coups
d’épée entre gens qui s’aiment ne font que ragaillardir
l’affection.’ You observe the colouring is not quite what
it should be?”</p>

<p>“In this light the beard is of rather a peculiar tint,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Yes: the painter did not do it justice. It was most
lovely, and gave him such a distinguished air, quite
different from the common herd. Stay, I will show you
the exact colour, if you will come near this flambeau!”
And going near the light, she took off a bracelet of hair,
with a magnificent clasp of pearls. It was peculiar,
certainly. I did not know what to say. “His precious
lovely beard!” said she. “And the pearls go so well
with the delicate blue!”</p>

<p>Her husband, who had come up to us, and waited till
her eye fell upon him before venturing to speak, now
said, “It is strange Monsieur Ogre is not yet arrived!”</p>

<p>“Not at all strange,” said she, tartly. “He was
always very stupid, and constantly falls into mistakes,
in which he comes worse off; and it is very well he
does, for he is a credulous and cowardly fellow. Not at
all strange! If you will”—turning to her husband, so
that I hardly heard her words, until I caught—”Then
everybody would have their rights, and we should have
no more trouble. Is it not, monsieur?” addressing me.</p>

<p>“If I were in England, I should imagine madame was
speaking of the reform bill, or the millennium,—but I
am in ignorance.”</p>

<p>And just as I spoke, the great folding-doors were
thrown open wide, and every one started to their feet
to greet a little old lady, leaning on a thin black wand—and—</p>

<p>“Madame la Féemarraine,” was announced by a
chorus of sweet shrill voices.</p>

<p>And in a moment I was lying in the grass close by a
hollow oak-tree, with the slanting glory of the dawning
day shining full in my face, and thousands of little birds
and delicate insects piping and warbling out their welcome
to the ruddy splendour.</p>
