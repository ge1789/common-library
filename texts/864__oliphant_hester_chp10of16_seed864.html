<!--Chapter title: CHAPTER X. A LOVER. -->

<p>It was about this time that Hester became aware
of a circumstance the most important that could
possibly happen in a young woman’s life. There
had been no opportunity for her to become acquainted
with the emulations and rivalship of other
girls. Girls there were none about the Vernonry,
nor did they abound in the neighbourhood, in the
class from which alone her mother’s visitors were
chosen. Mrs. John, it has been said, belonged to
a county family, a fact of which she was as proud as
it is natural and becoming a woman should be. She
did not altogether frown upon the few callers from
the town who thought it only their duty to Miss
Vernon, the most hospitable entertainer in the
neighbourhood, to take a little notice of the pensioners,
as the poor ladies at the Vernonry were
called; but she did not encourage these benevolent
visitors. “They are all ladies, and as good as any
of us,” Mrs. Redfern had been heard to say, who was
the mayor’s lady, and considered herself a leader of
society; and it was a beautiful sight to see Mrs.
John, in her old-fashioned dark room and simplest
black gown, receiving with kind condescension, and
endeavouring to set at her ease, this very fine lady,
who considered herself to be paying the poor widow
a quite undeserved honour. Mrs. John returned
cards only in acknowledgment of Mrs. Redfern’s
visit, and there the acquaintance ended. So that
Hester lost altogether the opportunity of knowing
how ordinary girls looked and talked, and what was
the object of their ambition. She had not even,
which may surprise some people, come to any conclusion
whatever in respect to her own personal
appearance. Sometimes indeed, it cannot be denied,
she had looked up in the midst of a novel, where
all the young persons in whom the reader was
supposed to take any interest were beautiful, and
asked herself vaguely, with a blush, feeling ashamed
of the question, whether she was pretty. But partly
she was ashamed to give the time necessary to the
solution of the problem, and partly she had not the
data upon which to form her conclusions. There
was a beautiful girl in Redborough in a humble
position, upon whose claims everybody was agreed,
but she was a queenly creature, with dark hair
and blue eyes, and features of the most exquisite
regularity, to whom Hester could not flatter herself
that she bore the slightest resemblance. Nor was
she like Ellen Vernon, with her lovely fairness, her
look of wax and confectionary. Hester was not
ethereal at all. There was no smallness about her,
though she was slim as became her age. “The
springy motion in her gait,” the swift, light step
which never tired, were beautiful in their way, and
so was the eager outlook in her eyes, which seemed
to contract and expand according to the degree of
interest with which outside subjects moved them;
but all this rather as exponents of the mind within
than as merely physical features. Her hair had
never grown long, not much longer indeed than was
just necessary to twist into the knot behind which
proved her to be grown up, and it remained full of
curl and ready to break the smoothness of outline
then thought necessary, on the smallest provocation.
Her complexion was very variable, sometimes radiant
with flutters of sudden colour, sometimes relapsing
into a rose-tinted whiteness, more white than pale.
Her features were not much to brag of; it was the
play of prompt feeling in her face, the interest, the
indignation, the pity, the perpetual change and
vicissitude, that made it attractive, and on this
point of course Hester could not judge. Seeing
that her mouth was too large, and her nose too
short, and her eyebrows too marked, she concluded
that she was not pretty, and regretted it, though in
her circumstances it mattered very little; her friends
liked her just as well, whether or not; and she was
never likely to produce the effect which the heroines
in novels—even though comparatively plain—did
produce. So she decided, with a little shame to
think that she could have been disturbed about the
matter, that it was not worth going into it further.
All the same it is a pity, for the sake of young
readers, that all the girls in novels, with so very
rare exceptions—and Jane Eyre, if not pretty,
probably was less plain than she thought, and certainly
was <i>agaçante</i>, which is much more effective—should
be beautiful and should have so much
admiration and conquest. The girls who read are
apt to wonder how it is that they have not the same
fortune. Hester, for her part, had a fine scorn of
feminine victories in this sort; they had never come
within the possibilities of her lot. She never went
to balls, nor met in society gangs of suitors contending
for her smile; she did not believe in such
things, and she thought she despised them.</p>

<p>It was in the very midst of this scepticism that
she suddenly became aware of certain facts which,
as we have said, were of the kind generally supposed
to be most important in a young woman’s life.
Harry Vernon had been for some time alone in the
splendour of the White House; Ellen, who had
inflicted so deep a wound upon Hester’s inexperienced
girlhood, had married the previous summer,
and in the lack of young ladies worthy to swell her
train on that occasion, had selected Hester as one of
her bridesmaids. Hester had never forgiven her
frivolous kinswoman for that first disenchantment
of her youth, but her mother, upon whom her
exclusion from society and from all opportunities of
distinguishing herself there weighed heavily, had
insisted on the acceptance of the invitation, and
Hester had figured accordingly in a white muslin
frock, much too simple to match the toilette of the
other bridesmaids in the pageant, greatly to her own
disquiet. She was the only Vernon in it, and thus
had been specially put forward, and Ellen, altogether
unconscious of previous offence, had exhausted herself
in demonstrations of affection to her young
relative. It was she whom Harry led out in the
morning’s procession, and he had, in the intervals
of his duty to his guests, come back again and again
to her side. Hester, all inexperienced and unknowing,
had paid little attention to these early indications.
She did not identify him with his sister’s
guilt towards her. He was a weak, good-natured,
genial fellow, and no more. If Harry did anything
wrong, no doubt it was because of being led astray.
In himself he wished nothing but good to any one.
He was not clever, he was steady and stolid, and
went through both work and pleasure without much
discrimination as to which was which, carrying on
both in the same way. When he began to come
to the Vernonry evening after evening, Hester paid
little attention to him. She would go out to walk
with old Captain Morgan in the very face of the
young visitor whose “intentions” all the community
considered to be of such importance. Hester never
thought of his “intentions.” She had none herself
in which he was anyhow involved. She was perfectly
friendly when they met, but she did not care
whether they ever met or not, and repulsed him as
much as steady indifference can repulse an obstinate
and not very clear-sighted young man. But this
was not saying much. Harry knew as well as any
one that his suit was a wonderful chance for his
distant cousin; that Hester had no right to look for
such good fortune as that of being the object of his
affections. He knew that he was bringing in his
hand everything a girl need wish for. And so far
as Hester’s course of action was concerned, though
he was much irritated by it sometimes, he still felt
that it was what she had a right to employ in the
circumstances. It “drew a fellow on;” she was right
to do what she could to obtain this so desirable
consummation. He could not find fault with her
even when he was angry. Had she been too ready
to meet him, he felt that he would himself have
despised what was so easily won. But her coyness,
her apparent indifference, her walking out to the
old captain from her lover, all helped to rivet his
chains. It was excellent policy, and he took it as
such; it drew a fellow on.</p>

<p>And it would be impossible to describe the interest
of the Vernonry in this new development. Harry
made his appearance first when they were all outside
enjoying the beauty of the summer evening,
Mr. Mildmay Vernon occupying that bench in front
of the verandah, which was the most desirable place
in the evening, being just clear of the low sunbeams
which came into your eyes through the trunks of
the pines, penetrating like golden arrows. Mrs.
John herself was watering the plants in the verandah,
which were a little exhausted by the long, scorching
day, and wanted refreshment. The Miss Vernon-Ridgways
were walking about with their long sashes
extended and their large sleeves flying, the one
eagerly talking from a few paces behind her, to the
other. Their conversation was on the well-worn
subject of “some people who never knew their own
place,” and was aimed at the tranquil gentleman on
the bench, who when he had secured his own comfort,
which was the first thing to be thought of,
rather prided himself upon never interfering with
his neighbours. When Harry Vernon appeared,
there was a universal stir. The sisters made a little
flight round him, gazing at him. “I do believe it
is Harry. Is it Harry?” they said. Mr. Mildmay
Vernon put down his paper in the midst of a paragraph,
and came forward with his most genial air.
“I hope this is a visit only. I hope there is nothing
wrong,” he said.</p>

<p>“Wrong! what should be wrong?” said Harry,
turning his fair countenance wonderingly upon the
group. “It’s a lovely evening, and I wanted a walk,”
he added, with a little reddening of that too fair
face; “and besides, I’ve got a message from Ellen
to Mrs. John——”</p>

<p>“Dear Ellen! How is Ellen? When is she
coming home?” cried Miss Matilda. “When you
write to her, give her our love. But I suppose she
is too happy to care about anybody’s love save one
person’s. Marriage will improve Ellen—marriage
will steady her. She used to be a little forgetful,
perhaps. Ah! marriage will do her a great deal
of good. She had everything too much her own
way.”</p>

<p>“But she is missed. It would be pretty to see her
again—forgetting,” said Mr. Mildmay, “that she had
ever set eyes on you before.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear Ellen! We should not have known
her without her little ways!”</p>

<p>Now Harry was fond of his sister.</p>

<p>“I’ll thank you to leave Ellen alone,” he said,
brusquely. “I dare say we’ve all got our little ways.
I had something to say to Mrs. John if you’ll let
me pass, please.”</p>

<p>“Politeness is characteristic of our family,” said
Miss Matilda, drawing her skirts closely round her,
and standing ostentatiously, though she was not very
near him, out of his way.</p>

<p>Mrs. John stood looking on in the verandah with
the watering-can in her hand, not hearing much of
what they said, but feeling that it was uncivil, and
putting on a little deprecating, anxious smile—</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said, “come in. The parlour, I
think, is almost cooler than the garden after this hot
day. Shall I make you a cup of tea?”</p>

<p>“These pensioners of Aunt Catherine’s are odious
people,” said Harry. “It was you and Hester I came
to see.”</p>

<p>“You must not speak of them so—they would not
like it,” said Mrs. John, not thinking that she herself
might be spoken of in the same way, though rather
pleased at the bottom of her heart that Harry should
make a distinction between them. He threw himself
down in a chair, which creaked under his weight,
and looked very large and mannish in the little
feminine room—rather, indeed, it must be allowed,
out of place there.</p>

<p>“I wonder how you can get on in such a poky
little place,” he said. “I should like to see you in
handsome big rooms; it would seem much more
natural.”</p>

<p>Mrs. John smiled again, a deprecating, half-apologetic
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am very glad to be here. I did not expect
ever to have to live in such a poor place when I
married, it is true; but people’s minds change with
their circumstances. I am glad to have it——”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to—you should have been provided
for in a different way. Ah, Hester! I am so glad to
see you,” Harry said, rising with some commotion to
his feet. He took Hester’s hand and held it for a
moment. “I thought I’d come and tell you about
Ellen,” he said, with a blush.</p>

<p>“Hester,” said her mother, giving her a little
meaning look, of which she did not understand the
signification, “you must give Mr. Harry a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>And there he sat, to her great oppression, for an
hour at least. He did not even tell them about Ellen.
He said nothing in particular—nothing which it
was necessary to say. Hester, who had intended
to go out with her old captain, felt herself bound by
politeness and her mother’s warning looks. She did
not know what these looks meant, but they held her
fast. There was not very much conversation.
He said a few things over and over, which made it
difficult to change the subject; and it was mostly
Mrs. John who replied, and who rather liked, also,
to repeat the same sentiment. Hester poured out
the tea, and when the moment came for that,
lighted the candles, and sat down in the background
and took her work. She was not very fond of work,
but it was better than doing nothing at all. When
she took that seat which was beyond his point of
vision, Harry turned his chair round so as to face
her, and took up one of the candles and arranged it
for her, that she might see to work. “You should
have a lamp,” he said. “I have a nice little lamp at
home just the thing for you; you must let me send
it.” What a long time he sat, and how anxious he
was to make himself agreeable! After that he came
three or four times in succession. Mrs. John began
to look for him, brightening up as the hour of his
visit approached; and the neighbours kept up a
watch which it was impossible to mistake. “If he
comes to-night again I shall know what to think,”
Miss Matilda said. But when he came that night he
met Hester at the gate in her out-door apparel.
Harry’s countenance fell.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are surely not going out,” he said, “not
just when I come? You couldn’t be so unkind.”</p>

<p>“I have been unkind to Captain Morgan very
often,” said Hester. “I must not neglect him to-night,”
and she passed him quickly with a little bow
and smile. It made Harry very angry, but still he
felt that it drew a fellow on.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, when Hester eluded
him in this way, Harry spoke his mind to Mrs. John.</p>

<p>“I’m very lonely up there by myself,” he said,
“and I have nobody to please but myself. Ellen
used to interfere and keep me in order, as she said;
but now she’s got somebody else to look after. I’ve
thought a great deal of Hester for years back. That
time when we came to see you first, you know, when
Ellen made so many advances and forgot all about
them—that was her way. She’s not a bad sort when
you get safe hold of her—but it’s her way. Well,
from that time I’ve thought of Hester, though I
never liked to say a word as long as Ellen was
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Harry,” said Mrs. John, who was
fluttered and flattered as if a proposal were being
made to herself. “She was only a child in those
days.”</p>

<p>“I know; but she isn’t a child now. If she’ll
have me—and I can’t see why she shouldn’t have me—we
might all make each other very comfortable.
I’m not frightened of a mother-in-law as so many
fellows are. I believe that’s all bosh. I shouldn’t
wish to part you more than for the honeymoon, you
know. There is plenty of room for you in the White
House, and it would be always nice for her to have
you there, when I happened to be engaged. I think
we should hit it off very well together. And as for
money—I know she has no money—I should never
think twice about that. Of course it would be to my
own advantage to make as good settlements as
possible, which is always a good thing in business
when one never knows what may happen. We might
have to consult Aunt Catherine just at first, for she
always keeps a hold on the funds——”</p>

<p>“And there’s Hester to consult—that is the most
important,” said Mrs. John.</p>

<p>“To be sure, that’s the most important; but I
can’t see why she should object,” said Harry. “Why,
she has never seen any one, has she? I am the only
man that has paid any attention to her. At Ellen’s
wedding there were one or two, and that was only
once in a way. I don’t say she likes me, but she
can’t like any one else, can she? for she has never
seen anybody.”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” said Mrs. John; “but, Mr.
Harry, girls are so fanciful. You cannot be sure of
them in that way. They may have some ideal in
their heads, though they have never met any
one——”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Harry, making a large mouthful of
the word, and opening wide those blue eyes of his
with the light lashes. And, indeed, he did not
know much about that sort of thing. He returned
to the question without paying any attention to this
strange piece of nonsense. “There’s nobody about
but the old gentlemen, and Ned at Aunt Catherine’s.
Sometimes I’ve felt a little suspicious of
Ned. Does he come and see you often? He is a
great fellow for books and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Edward Vernon,” said Mrs. John, a little
stiffly, “<i>never</i> comes here. Hester, I believe has met
him at the Grange or elsewhere; but he never comes
here. I scarcely know him, neither of course does
she.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Harry, taking no notice of the offence
in her tone, but bringing down his hand vehemently
upon his knee, “if it isn’t Ned, there is no one she
can have seen, and the field is all clear for me.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” said Hester’s mother, but her
tone was doubtful. “At the same time,” she continued,
“perhaps it would be well to let me talk to
her a little first, Mr. Harry, just to see, before you
said anything.”</p>

<p>“If she doesn’t want to have me, I don’t wish to
force her to have me,” said Harry, his pride taking
alarm.</p>

<p>“Force—oh, Mr. Harry, do you think I would
force my child? And indeed I couldn’t;” cried Mrs.
John, shaking her head. “She is far, far stronger
than I.”</p>

<p>“She would be the cleverest of us all,” said Harry
admiringly. “I believe she is as clever as Aunt
Catherine. I dare say she might even find out
dodges in the bank, like Aunt Catherine did. Perhaps
on the whole it might be better if you would
sound her a bit, eh? and find out what she is up to.
What she thinks of me, for instance,” said Harry,
nodding half with modesty, half with vanity. “Yes,
I should like that. I should like to be pretty sure
before I committed myself. A man doesn’t like to
make a fool of himself for nothing,” the young man
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. John thought it was quite natural. And
indeed all her feelings were enlisted on Harry’s side,
who expressed himself so beautifully. What better
could happen to Hester than to be thus uplifted to
the heights of luxury and wealth, the White House,
and everything else that heart could desire, with a
nice husband, so good-looking, so tall, so fair, and so
anxious to be kind to her mother? Her imagination,
not her strong point on ordinary occasions, was
strong enough on this, to jump at all the advantages
of the match with a rapidity which would not have
disgraced Hester herself. To see her child the
mistress of the White House was the very height of
Mrs. John’s ambition. She did not feel that the
world held anything more desirable. Her mind
made a hurried rush through the rooms, all so
familiar to her, and which Harry, no doubt, would
re-model in preparation for his bride. With what
pride and happiness would she see her child at the
head of the table, where she herself had once sat!
It would be a return more triumphant than any
return in her own person. And yet she would be
there too, the happy spectator, the witness of it all.
She saw in her mind’s eye, the wedding, the beautiful
clothes, the phaeton, and the high-stepping
horses, and perhaps a pony carriage which Hester
herself would drive. All this in a moment, while
Harry was telling her that he would like to be pretty
sure before he committed himself. Perhaps it was
not a lofty sentiment, but she felt it to be quite
natural. A man with so much to bestow had a
right to see his way before him, and then for Hester’s
own sake it was far better that she should not be
taken by surprise. She was a perverse girl, and if
the young man walked straight up to her without
warning, and asked her to marry him, the chances
were that she would refuse. That was not a risk to
be run when so much was at stake.</p>

<p>“If you will leave it in my hands, I think you
will have no cause to regret it,” she said, nodding
her head at him with the softest maternal smile.
“You may be sure you will have my good wishes.”</p>

<p>They were both quite affected when he took his
leave.</p>

<p>“I feel sure we should hit it off together,” Harry
said, warmly grasping her hand; and the water stood
in her eyes. She could almost have given him a kiss
as he stood before her, a little flushed and agitated
with his self-revelation. Indeed, she would have
done so but for that doubt about Hester. What
would Hester say? That was the one point upon
which doubt existed, and unfortunately it was the
most important of all. There could not be the least
uncertainty as to the many advantages of the
match; money, comfort, good position, good connection,
everything that can be wished for in
marriage, and with no personal defects to be glossed
over by these advantages, but a fine young man, a
husband any girl might be proud of. Elation and
gladness filled Mrs. John’s heart, when she contemplated
that side of the question; but when she
turned to the other a chill came over her, a cloud
that swallowed up the sunshine. What would
Hester say? Oh the perverseness of girls that
never know what is good for them! If it had been
somebody quite ineligible, somebody without a
penny, the chances were that Hester would have had
no doubt on the subject. Mrs. John could not
remain still after this momentous conversation. She
went from one window to another, looking out,
watching for her daughter’s return. She had been
vexed that Hester should have been so uncivil as to
go away for no better reason than to walk with old
Captain Morgan when Harry was coming, but she
felt now that this contradictoriness on the girl’s part
had been providential. How full her head was with
thoughts and plans how to speak, and what to say, with
artful approaches to the subject, and innocent wiles
by which to divert all suspicion, and lead Hester
unawares towards that goal! She trotted up stairs
and down, from one window to another, framing
dialogue after dialogue in her mind. She was
astonished by her own powers as she did so. If she
ever had been so clever in reality as she was in this
sudden crisis of imagination, she felt that it might
have made a difference in her whole life. And one
thing Mrs. John had the wisdom and goodness to do
in the midst of her excitement, she kept within her
own house, and did not so much as venture down to
the verandah, where she might have been seen from
outside, and pounced upon by the eager watchers,
brimful of curiosity, who wanted to know what it all
meant. Miss Matilda Vernon-Ridgway, as has been
intimated, had been conscious of an internal admonition
that something critical, something decisive,
something throwing a distinct light upon the “intentions”
of young Harry would happen this night.
And Mrs. John knew herself, and was aware that
she never would be able to stand against the questionings
of these curious spectators. Her only safety
was in keeping out of their way. Thus not only
her imaginations, but her moral faculties, her power
of self-control and self-denial, were strengthened by
the occurrences of this momentous evening. She
had not felt so important before since Hester was
born.</p>
