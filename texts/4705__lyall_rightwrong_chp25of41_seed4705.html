<p>The spirit of bitterness may wind itself into our

<p>Stunned and dazed, not as yet feeling very acutely, Joscelyn passed from the death-bed of his leader and friend into the High
Street, where but few people were stirring. He went straight to Arthur Goodwin’s quarters to bear him the news, only pausing once when a great brawny-armed smith, catching sight of him, flung down his hammer on the anvil and ran out from his forge with an eager question.</p>

<p>“What news of Mr. Hampden, sir?”</p>

<p>“All is over,” said Joscelyn, in a numb voice.</p>

<p>But even as he uttered the words he felt how false they were, and watching the blacksmith’s passionate outburst of grief, he realised that Hampden’s work on this earth was not over—was, in truth, only just beginning—and that for all time his name would serve as inspiration and example to those who sought righteousness, freedom,
and progress.</p>

<p>There was no need to speak the actual news to Colonel Goodwin ; he saw it written plainly enough in the young officer’s face, and, touched by sorrow so deep and genuine, he put his arm within Joscelyn’s and walked back with him to see if he could help Sir Robert Pye in making the necessary arrangements for the funeral.</p>

<p>“Every honest man hath a share in this loss, and therefore will likewise share in our sorrow,” he said; “and truly God takes away the best amongst us. Take it all, I think he was not to any man living second. Did he speak again ?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir ; I believe his last conversation was with you. Just at the last Dr. Giles tried to rouse him from the sleep in which for six hours he had lain; the King had sent to offer his surgeon from Oxford. But, like the troops at Chalgrove, the help came too late.”</p>

<p>“The King sent, say you ? What does that bode, I wonder ?” said Goodwin. Only at the beginning of this month his Majesty was taking part in a plot by which Pym and Hampden were to be treacherously
seized at night in their beds. Having failed in that, did he think to conciliate the most powerful man of the day ? If so, it shows how little he understood the character of our dead leader.”</p>

<p>“May not his Majesty have sent the message out of pure humanity ?”
said Joscelyn.</p>

<p>Arthur Goodwin was silent ; personally he had small reason to believe in the King’s kind-heartedness, being one of the two who
were specially excepted by Charles in the general pardon he offered to the county of Buckingham, but he would not urge anything against the more generous thought of his young companion, and indeed at that
moment they reached the house and encountered Sir Robert Pye.</p>

<p>It was deemed best that the funeral should take place on the next day ; for in time of war there was no possibility of observing the usual tedious formalities. Moreover, the family were already in deep mourning for Mrs. Knightley. When these details had been settled, Joscelyn was despatched to Hampden House with a message, and in fact the whole of that day he was so continuously employed that he was able to hold in check the sorrow which he yet all the time knew would
sooner or later overwhelm him.</p>

<p>The 25th of June, unlike the previous Sunday when they had fought under a cloudless sky at Chalgrove, was sultry and oppressive ; a sort of blight seemed to hang over the place, not a breath of air was
stirring, and in the distance, from time to time, could be heard prolonged, rumbling thunder, as though away among the Chilterns
some battle raged.</p>

<p>Joscelyn, whose rest during the past week had been of the briefest, slept late that morning, and was only roused by the
tolling of the great bell in the tower of the church. Hastily dressing, he went down to the death-chamber to see if in any way he
could be of service.</p>

<p>There was nothing for him to do. All the preparations were complete ; the hastily-made unpretentious coffin was closed, the blue banner of the Parliament had been thrown across it, and upon the lid had been placed the patriot’s sword and helmet.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment with bent head in that awful, silent blankness ; then, beginning faintly to realise the irreparable loss their cause had sustained, he turned away with heaving breast and dim eyes, unable to endure the oppression of his surroundings. At the back of the house a long strip of garden ground led down to the meadows ; here he paced to and fro, struggling to bear up under that crushing load of sorrow, under that great national loss which only became more appalling as it was more fully understood. All the customary platitudes of comfort were powerless to touch his heart now ; he could only think of the great statesman cut off in his prime, of that mighty influence for good removed from Parliament, of the gallant leader—whom so many had longed to see at the head of the army—betrayed to his death by a mercenary time-server like Hurry.</p>

<p>As he paced beside the homely fruit trees and currant bushes, and past the strawberry beds whose heavy fragrance filled the air, the solemn tolling of the great bell in Thame tower ceased, and the bells began to ring a muffled peal. Then he knew that he must return to the house, and joining the other mourners, he took his place in the long, sad procession which followed the body of John Hampden to the grave. Borne by his brave green-coats down the broad street of Thame, along the country road he had so often travelled in life, amid the tears of all beholders, that simple pathetic funeral train passed on. When they reached Hampden House the soldiers bore the coffin through the old banqueting-hall to the brick parlour where Hampden had in past times so often toiled, and where years before he had been summoned for his refusal to pay the ship-money. Here, while the soldiers dined in the hall, the women of the family gathered to take in private their last silent farewell of the dead. Joscelyn being presently summoned to speak with old Madam Hampden, found them still weeping round the coffin, and Hampden’s mother, seeing how greatly he was moved, drew him a little aside, and, laying her hand on his arm, spoke to him with almost motherly tenderness.</p>

<p>“I know how well you loved him,” she said, “and how great an affection he had for you. They tell me you must leave for London this very day. Is that indeed the case ?”</p>

<p>“My leave has nearly expired, madam,” explained Joscelyn, “and as it is necessary that I see Sir Robert Neal on my way to the west, I must not delay any longer.”</p>

<p>“They told me you would probably lie at Katterham for a night,” said Madam Hampden, “and I thought you would kindly bear this little token to Sir Robert. ‘Tis a small volume of Plato which my dear son valued and constantly read. Here, too, is one of his seals for your promised wife ; they tell me ladies now set great store by seals, and
I know Clemency will like some remembrance of him. And as for you, Captain Heyworth—you who have been so great a comfort to us all through this sad week—if you care to have it, I should like to give you the Bible he carried through this campaign.”</p>

<p> It was a tiny volume with gilt edges, one of those “pocket Bibles” which excited the special derision of the Cavaliers, and which—only lately issued—were used by vast numbers of the Parliamentary officers.</p>

<p>As Joscelyn took it with warm and grateful thanks, there flashed through his mind many a strange camp-scene in which he had seen that little volume in the hand of his lost leader. Bidding a sad farewell to the daughters of the house and to the noble-hearted Lady Letitia, he returned to the hall, where once more the mournful procession
formed, and the walls of the old house rang and echoed as the soldiers’ voices rose in a great reassuring burst of song, the
metrical version of the 90th Psalm.</p>

<p>A fortnight before they had spent that happy Sunday together, with Hampden as the life of the party ; now, as Joscelyn glanced back, he saw the broken-hearted wife, the mother, the poor weeping girls, watching at the far end of the hall, while, in advance, the soldiers bore the body of their Colonel to its last resting-place, and the sad-hearted little heir—not yet twelve years old—walked behind, holding fast to Sir Robert Pye’s hand, and bravely struggling to keep back his tears.</p>

<p>With arms reversed, they marched through the quiet park to the churchyard gate, where the Rector met them with the words of good cheer spoken ages ago at Bethany, and passing into the church the soldiers laid the body of John Hampden beside the tombs of his forefathers in the chancel, near the touchingly-worded memorial which he had dedicated to his dead wife. It seemed as if that whole congregation—and they were but the representatives of thousands
of absent mourners—took most literally the beautiful phrase in the burial service—”Our dear brother here departed.” The dead statesman who for two-and-twenty years had toiled for them and their rights
in Parliament ; the champion of truth and righteousness, who alone and single-handed had fought a tyrannical king and seven servile judges, enduring imprisonment, obloquy, and slander ; the soldier with his matchless courage, his rare modesty, his devotion to the country, had been, in spite of his great wealth and ancient pedigree,
simply and literally their brother, more fully in sympathy with them than any other man of that time.</p>

<p>Joscelyn had made his farewells at the house and did not again return to it ; he ordered Latimer to be saddled, and when the crowd had dispersed to see the soldiers return, he once more entered the church, and passing into the deserted chancel, knelt beside the open grave.</p>

<p>Then at last the floodgates of his grief were opened ; with choking sobs that shook his whole frame he fell forward on the stone
slab which before long would cover Hampden’s tomb, weeping the most bitter tears of his whole life.</p>

<p>Presently a sound of footsteps in the porch made him spring to his feet, and, with an effort, drive back those signs of grief which no Hey worth quite forgave himself for showing; before others.</p>

<p>The sexton and his assistants had come to finish their work. Joscelyn with bowed head hurried past them, made his way to the stables, mounted his horse, and rode away from the place which must for ever be bound up with his most precious memories.</p>

<p>A summer shower was something of a relief to him, and by and by the sun shone out for the first time that day. He paused for a minute to look back at the lovely landscape with its verdant hills and wooded valleys, and saw in the distance the Whiteleaf Cross, commemorating an old Saxon victory over Danish invaders, clearly
marked on the hill -side, while resting over it was the upward spring of the arch of a brilliant rainbow.</p>

<p>The sight cheered his heavy heart. Hope springing from self-sacrifice, light from cruel loss, the world’s greater gain from the living of a noble, manly life ! Were not these undying realities ? Vaguely he had known it all long ago, but through the life and
death of Hampden the truths had gained for him new force and meaning.</p>

<p>Riding that night as long as the light served him, he slept at one of the comfortable roadside inns, at that time much more
plentiful, and very early the next morning resumed his journey to London. He found the whole place in mourning over the news of Hampden’s death, while intense bitterness had been stirred up by the rancorous attacks made upon him by the Royalists. The one which perhaps angered Joscelyn the most was the attack in the <i>Mercurius Aulicus</i>, published, on the very day of Hampden’s death, at Oxford. It raked up again that strange farrago of mingled truth
and falsehood with regard to Hampden’s private sorrows which had wounded the bereaved father s heart, at a time when one might have expected even a fiend to hold his peace. Many of the nobler spirits among the King’s followers, such as Falkland and Hop ton and Chillingworth, preserved a reverent silence, and doubtless mourned the loss of a noble enemy. But the servile court liars gathered about the grave of the dead man like ghouls, and disgraced themselves
by promulgating the vilest personalities of party warfare.</p>

<p>Joscelyn, young and hot-headed, was affected very grievously by these attacks on his dead leader. An older man might have borne them with greater philosophy, and have treated them with the calm disdain they deserved. But he was lacking in the faculty of disdain, and as he rode down to Katterham there was a hard, bitter look on his face which had never been there before.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Neal was quick to note the change in him and to understand its cause. When he had heard the details of his friend’s death he turned the subject quietly, and began to talk of Clemency and of the future, alluding to the marriage-contract which had been signed in London.</p>

<p>“These are but ill days,” he said, “for marrying and giving in marriage. But I am an old man and growing feeble, and I should like to see Clemency your wife before I die.”</p>

<p>They then spoke of the journey which Clemency had to make from Gloucester, and of its difficulties and perils, arranging that, if any break in the war should come and hostilities be for a time suspended, it might be advisable for the marriage to take place from Christopher Bennett’s house, so that Joscelyn should himself be able
to escort his bride to Katterham.</p>

<p>But, alas ! any cessation of the strife seemed then but little likely. The prospects of the Parliamentary party became clay by day darker ; Pym was in failing health, Essex was torpid and timorous, troops from the north were hastening to join the King at Oxford, London itself was threatened, from the west came news of Royalist triumphs—and Hampden was dead.</p>

<p>Small wonder that, as Joscelyn journeyed down to Somersetshire, the iron entered into his soul when he mused on the rejoicings of the Cavaliers over the loss that had well-nigh broken his heart. Small wonder that he thought of the King with something like loathing when he pictured him as rewarding the deserter Hurry with the honour of knighthood for his services at Chalgrove—Hurry the renegade, once a comrade of Hampden’s, yet not ashamed to spend the very Sunday of his burial in attacking and plundering the Parliamentary quarters at Wycombe, slaughtering some of the same troops he had once led.</p>

<p>It was in this sore-hearted and bitter state that he arrived, on the evening of the 1st July, at the village of North Cadbury, in Somersetshire, and having been directed by a shepherd-boy to the parsonage, rode up to the door just as the sun was setting. Whichcote and his young bride had been walking in the garden, and seeing the unexpected guest dismount, hastened forward to receive him, though for a minute the tutor failed to recognise his former pupil in this stern-faced officer with his compressed, bitter-looking mouth and sorrowful eyes. But Joscelyn, seeing his master’s broad-browed and most winning face once more, and recalling at the sight his happy life at Cambridge, forgot for a moment
his grief, and with kindling eyes and all his old warmth of manner hastened forward with eager greetings.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, sir, for coming in this unceremonious fashion,” he said,” but I am on my way to join Sir William Waller, who I learn is now at Bath, and being commissioned to bear you a watch bequeathed
to you by Mr. Gainsborough, of Lincoln, I thought I had best deliver it in person.”</p>

<p>Whichcote gave him a most cordial greeting and introduced him to his wife.</p>

<p>I scarcely knew you for the moment,” he said, apologetically ;
“and, indeed, had thought you were travelling abroad ; but I see you have elected to stay and play your part in this troubled land of ours.”</p>

<p>No word in relation to politics had ever before passed between them—it had been a subject which Joscelyn in his Cambridge days had carefully avoided. Nor had he ever regarded Whichcote as a Puritan, though he had lately learnt that he was one of the most broad-minded supporters of the cause.</p>

<p>Whichcote walked with him to the stable, Joscelyn preferring to see to his favourite horse himself, and explaining how much he valued him.</p>

<p>“He was with me at Chalgrove Field,” he said, “and during Colonel Hampden’s last ride back to Thame.”</p>

<p>“You knew Colonel Hampden, then?” said Whichcote. “That was indeed a better training for you than months of travel in Europe. Truly all England mourns when such an one dies.”</p>

<p>Then, seeing the spasm of pain which passed over the young man’s face, Which cote quietly changed the subject, and led him back to the parsonage, where, though all was simple and unostentatious, there was nevertheless the dainty freshness and the careful arrangement which characterises the first home of a happily-wedded pair. After supper he took him into the little room which served for his study, and sitting there by the open window in the fading light,
they talked together of all that had passed since their parting a year ago. It was indeed hard to realise that it was but a year, for Joscelyn had leapt from careless boyhood into manhood laden with care, while his natural hopefulness, which had carried him through so many troubles, seemed in the great shock of Hampden’s death to have been crushed out of him.</p>

<p>Whichcote was quick to note that he sought refuge in bitter words against the King and his party, not so much from any deeply-ingrained hatred as in the desperate attempt to relieve the overwhelming blankness of loss which all who had looked to Hampden as their champion and defender were now experiencing. He just let him
pour out all his wrath and grief, and then began in his quiet, finely-modulated voice to attempt some sort of reply.</p>

<p>“I am apt to think, Captain Heyworth,” he said, throwing the casement window a little wider open as he spoke, “that many who have been exasperated one against another, are far nearer to one another in sense than in words. In respect of God, who seeth hearts, they agree more than in the view of the world, which only sees outward expressions. I believe, for one real difference in matters of consequence between persons considerable, there are twenty mistakes of meanings ; and could they see one another’s hearts they would think better of one another.”</p>

<p>“Would you then, sir, wholly excuse these vile slanderers ?” said Joscelyn, the fierce light in his eyes still unsubdued.”</p>

<p>“Whosoever scornfully uses any other man,” said Whichcote,”
disparages himself the human nature. Opposites too often study to represent each other in the worst sense. Let us honestly endeavour to take our foes at their best ; for every man at his best will be found good for something.”</p>

<p>“What !” cried Joscelyn, “a traitor such as Hurry ? You cannot realise, sir, what he is, how vicious bis life, how altogether
without sense of honour, so that even the Cavaliers—whom God knows are not over particular—were shy of putting their confidence in such an one. I can well understand that a man may honourably change his views, but Hurry was so vile as to carry information to Oxford of the large sum of money being sent from London to the Lord-General
at Thame, and ‘twas in hopes of taking this prize that the expedition ending in the fight at Chalgrove was first set on foot.”</p>

<p>“I had not heard that,” said Whichcote. ” Few details reach us here in the country. Did Prince Rupert seize the money ?”</p>

<p>” No, sir ; by good fortune he missed it, for the burning of Chinnor and the noise of the fray warned the drivers of the waggons,
and they turned aside into the woods, waiting till the Cavaliers had passed by. Little was gained to the King by the expedition save a few prisoners and the death-wound of Colonel Hampden. ‘Tis for this last, clearly, that the King hath knighted that vile renegade.”</p>

<p>With difficulty he strangled a curse out of deference to his host, and pushing back his chair began to pace to and fro with
what Sir John Denham would have termed his “bull-in-the-net ” expression.</p>

<p>Whichcote, whose personal life happened at this time to be specially bright, was greatly moved by his companion’s troubles.
Himself still comparatively young, for he was at this time only four- and-thirty, he was able to understand Joscelyn’s state of mind much better than an older man might have done.”</p>

<p>“I have often thought of late,” he said, “that both joy and grief are things of great hazard and danger in the life of man. The one breaks the heart, the other intoxicates the head. An eye to God in both doth poise and balance.”</p>

<p>Joscelyn left off pacing to and fro. The words arrested him ; he came and stood by the open window looking out into the summer twilight, a calm like that of the dewy garden stealing over his troubled heart as he listened to his companion’s words.</p>

<p>“The state of religion,” continued Whichcote, quietly, “seems to me to consist in a divine frame and temper of mind ; and shows itself in a life and actions conformable to the Divine will. Religion is not a hearsay, a presumption, a supposition ; is not a
customary profession, is not an affectation of any mode, is not a piety of particular fancy, consisting in some pathetic devotions,
vehement expressions, bodily severities, affected anomalies, and aversions from the innocent ways of others ; but consisteth in
a profound humility and an universal charity.”</p>

<p>” Universal, sir ?” questioned Joscelyn, who had many of the qualities which go to make a good hater.</p>

<p>” Ay,” said Whichcote, smiling a little at his expression of face,
“universal. And remember that God imposeth no law of righteousness upon us which He doth not observe Himself. Too often men have an
itch rather to make religion than to use it ; but we are to use our religion, not to make it.”</p>

<p>Joscelyn sighed. ” Your standard, sir, seems to me altogether too high for one who has to live in the world now-a-days. The ideal is a noble one, but how should a man compass it ? how learn to love the base, the loveless, the oppressors ?”</p>

<p>“I know only of this way,” said Whichcote, his eyes looking far beyond the dim garden, as though reading the secrets of another world. ” We must learn of the Divine wisdom, imitate the Divine goodness, depend on the Divine power.”</p>

<p>The words never left Joscelyn’s memory, and he carried all through his life the recollection of the quiet Sunday that followed, and of the sermon that he heard Whichcote preach in North Cadbury church, on the thirty-first and thirty-second verses of the fourth chapter of the Letter to the Ephesians. Always he could hear the preacher’s clear voice pleading for the discharge from the heart of all ill-will and displeasure against others, and of that false zeal which degenerates into passion and interest, and is wholly unlike the Divine goodness, kindness, and clemency which it is our duty to imitate. The word “clemency ” for a time distracted Joscelyn. He missed a good deal that followed, and wandered off in thought to the
gabled house at Gloucester.</p>

<p>When he returned to the present the speaker was saying that differences of opinion must exist, for men must think as they found cause, and no man was master of his own apprehensions. Therefore, urged Whichcote, we must dwell on those points on which we do agree, and make allowance for the different tempers of men. Some mens apprehensions could not possibly hit in anything. They were cast in different moulds, and could no more help this than they could make their faces alike. But anger, ill-will, and displeasure disqualified
the mind from the pursuit of truth ; and the choicest piece of charity was to make fair interpretation and to put a candid construction on men’s actions. He would fain engage men to humanity, courtesy, and universal charity, so as, if it were possible, to promote a general reconciliation in the whole creation of God. Finally he claimed freedom in all points save only in this—that men are not at liberty to judge one another; and with one more strong appeal to his hearers to strive after a godlike frame and temper of mind, he brought to a close the most striking sermon that Joscelyn could ever remember hearing.</p>
