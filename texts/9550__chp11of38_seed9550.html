<!--CHAPTER XI.-->

<div><p>“No crime that taints the soul<br>
But brings its penalty.”</p></div>

<p>Adolph was certainly a prize in that huge lottery called marriage. He was the heir to his father’s title and the accumulated gold of two or three generations of successful money-makers—a man who could by reason of his money command the gratification of limitless desires. For what had yet been found to satisfy him whose soul, stained by vice, groans with satiety?</p>

<p>He was only thirty years old; but men of fifty have looked younger. He had a certain air of distinction that arises from contact with luxury. His face had no bad features, but the expression was evil, and the eye was dull. He had an air of discontent upon his sin-worn face that betrayed its own secret. Vice is always honest, however. It pays what it owes, and vice was dealing out the wages of death with a generous hand to its servant, Adolph.</p>

<p>He was, perhaps, no worse than many of his fellows, the <em>jeunesse doreé</em> of their social set who, when they have sounded the depths of impurity, bethink them of mating with purity by way of a change! Why not? In a world whose sole deity is mammon, the most desirable thing, speaking in parables, is to be sure of your good dinner always, without stint or fail; and’ what is so desirable for a daughter as to give her to a man who will be able, metaphorically speaking (be his other draw-backs what they may), to ensure her this luxury, and unable her to eat it, moreover, gorgeously equipped?</p>

<p>Adolph had no fear of not being able to find a young and guileless girl so soon as he should feel himself free to seek one. He knew half-a-dozen mothers who would readily welcome him, and think their daughters to be envied in having secured the affections of a man for whom even vice, from sheer satiety, had lost its savour. But at the present he was not wholly at liberty. The chains of an impecunious lady of fashion were around him, and he had not yet shaken himself free, although he was beginning to feel very tired of a state of things in which she drew all the prizes and he the blanks!</p>

<p>Lady Halfond, who thought her son the flower of creation, was rather proud than otherwise of this “friendship,” which lifted him into a social set above her own. The Halfonds, being only wealthy citizens, had had to trust to time and judicious “weeding” to ascend the social ladder to its topmost rung. Sir Max was in Parliament, it is true; but then so many men are in Parliament, that the position has ceased to be a social distinction in itself when unattended with other advantages. Carlyle, in his wrath, speaks of the “six hundred asses that compose the House of Commons”; one would have wished that he had compared them in his clemency to that other “six hundred who rode to their death under a murderous fire, since almost every Session is but another Balaclava in confusion and misdirected energy, the result of partisanship rather than patriotism, and remarkable only for the death-yawns of the majority, the poor rank and file of the six hundred who have had to ride to their death under the murderous fire of endless and often futile talk.</p>

<p>Adolph, beginning to tire of his fashionable tyrant, had made up his mind, now that his uncle was dead, to marry his cousin Alix, and settle down. He had long admired her as he had admired no other woman. Were the word “love” translatable in his vice-polluted mind, then he loved her. She was a splendid creature, a woman to be proud of—accomplished, intellectual, beautiful, wealthy. “None but the brave deserve the fair.” Adolph felt he deserved her!</p>

<p>He was not at all pleased to see two men already seated at table when he walked into the dining-room—one a stranger, the other a man he did not care for.</p>

<p>He showed his annoyance in his manner, by giving the barest nod of recognition to the one and the stiffest of bows to the other.</p>

<p>“What a contrast!” thought Alix, as he and Falkenham interchanged their scant courtesies. “They are typical men: one represents death, and the other life.”</p>

<p>The force of Falkenham’s remarks gained strength by such an apt illustration as her cousin offered to the man whose faculties were alive only on the side of death.</p>

<p>“It is quite an unexpected pleasure, this,” said Lady Hal-fond, as Adolph took his seat by Alix. “My son does not often give us the pleasure of his company at luncheon. We may thank you, Alix, for this.”</p>

<p>Alix, thus addressed, remained silent. She might have been tolerably civil to her cousin had not Falkenham been at the table. But with his presence opposite, she could not open her lips. She was conscious of a sense of shame that she belonged to such people, and that Falkenham should know it. With the exception of Adah, she disliked these particular relatives so much. They seemed such accentuated representatives of all that was despicable in her race that she felt lowered in her own estimation by being their kindred.</p>

<p>She was unjust to them, in one sense, for characters just as unlovely are bred in the British nation and in all nations among those who say to gold, “Thou art my god,” and to bigotry, “Thou art my religion.” It wants no fathering of certain qualities on certain races when the same qualities are rampant in every plutocracy. For the soil of the human heart yields always that which is sown, no matter what the nationality. Is not our British merchant every whit as keen after a good investment as his Semitic brother in the same craft?</p>

<p>Falkenham did not share Alix’s prejudices. His views of humanity were too broad and large for that. It was one of his pet “theories” that gradually and insensibly a new moving power in the world, the source of which the world was ignorant of while it admitted the fact, was levelling the walls of bigotry, and preparing men for the reign of that universal brotherhood which would merge all creeds into one belief, whose God should be the Divine Humanity.</p>

<p>Therefore, although distasteful to him as an individual, Lady Halfond represented nothing more than herself. He never thought of carrying on the idea of her and her ostentatious display of wealth, and the vulgarity of such display, to Alix. To him at present Alix was only an interesting girl whom his cousin was befriending. His mind was negative about her. He thought her beautiful—who that saw her did not ? It interested him to converse with her, but if he never met her again he would be unconscious of regret.</p>

<p>The conversation at luncheon after Adolph took his seat was suddenly covered with a pall of dulness. Margaret felt uncomfortable, knowing that Adolph was inimicable to Jocelyn, and Jocelyn, who never allowed any sort of sentiment to interfere with his appreciation of good wines and well-cooked food, addressed himself to his plate with relish, in undisturbed silence.</p>

<p>As soon as he could, Falkenham took his leave. Jocelyn remained on at a signal from Margaret.</p>

<p>It was a relief to all parties when Falkenham left; to Lady Halfond especially. She liked men who recognised her riches and paid court to her, Most of the men who visited her did this; the contrast of one who did not was an offence.</p>

<p>Margaret was piqued that she had been unsuccessful in extracting even one small “theory” from a man whom she could not but help admiring for himself. She would rather have attracted him than Jocelyn, for whom she had no very great admiration, but whom it amused her to keep always in her service. He would marry her if he could, that she knew, and the why of it she knew. But she had not yet made up her mind whether to take pity on him or not. Like many of her sex, she kept him hoping, as a sort of stop-gap, until a better man should present himself.</p>

<p>Alix was glad to see Falkenham leave, because she felt instinctively that he disliked his company as much as she did herself.</p>

<p>And as for Adolph, he regarded his presence among them as an intrusion.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” he enquired of Alix, as Falkenham left the room.</p>

<p>“A friend of Colonel Jocelyn’s.”</p>

<p>“That does not say much for him,” he returned, as he drew a chair next to the one Alix had taken on their return to the morning room, prepared to make himself fascinating.</p>

<p>He had a profound contempt for women as women. He believed them all to be led by their vanity; exorbitant of flattery, and none above the allurements of gain. He used to caress the idea that he was a profound student of women-nature because he had found his path a smooth and easy one among the worst of their kind. It was his confirmed opinion that every woman no less than every man is to be won if you can only discover the secret of their “price.”</p>

<p>Alix wished very much to be alone. She grew restless at his approach; but there was no escape for her. Lady Halfond and Adah were going out visiting, and Margaret had taken Colonel Jocelyn upstairs to the drawing-room under pretext of trying over some duets, in reality to get away from her brother’s eye ; and Alix found herself alone with Adolph.</p>

<p>“Do you know, if you will excuse me, I think I will go upstairs,” she said, rising in her anxiety to avoid a <em>tête-à-tête</em>.</p>

<p>“Just as I have come home on purpose to see you,” he said, looking up into her face with a smile intended to be insinuating, but which had the effect on Alix of making her shudder.</p>

<p>She sat down again resignedly, thinking it best to offer no further opposition ; as a rule she had been in the habit of enduring him by turning him into covert ridicule ; but to-day she was in no humour for repartee ; she threw herself back in her chair thinking:</p>

<p>“I can but be bored.”</p>

<p>When he saw her yield, he laid it down in his mind that, of course, she knew what she was about, and was not likely to turn her back on a man of his prospects. This view of the matter made him bold and familiar.</p>

<p>“My beautiful cousin! It would have been cruel to have run away from one so devoted to you,” he said, laying one of his hands on both hers that rested on her lap.</p>

<p>“None of that, Adolph,” she cried, with stifled resentment, as she snatched her hands away.</p>

<p>“You are so cold,” he murmured, rather pleased than otherwise with her resistance, which was a novelty for him.</p>

<p>It is curious to note how the worst of men always exact the most spotless purity from the woman they intend to marry. Surely it is not because they love virtue so much as that they fear vice. Betrayers themselves, they like to feel sure of not being betrayed.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me one thing?” he said presently.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“How are you to be won?”</p>

<p>“By you? not at all,” she answered shortly.</p>

<p>“How you coquette,” he said, with apparent despair, veiling amusement.</p>

<p>“Coquette!” she exclaimed, her magnificent eyes opening wide with astonishment. “Coquette with <em>you!</em> Why should I take the trouble? It is not even amusing.”</p>

<p>“You are too severe,” he said with a laugh; “you pique me to make you love me.”</p>

<p>“If you could possibly succeed I give you leave to do so,’ she answered indifferently.</p>

<p>“It is not so difficult as you think.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me how you would set about it. What are your tactics? You and I are such different people, such opposites. How could it be possible?”</p>

<p>“Quite possible; if a man takes the trouble to study a woman, and makes himself a slave to her every whim.”</p>

<p>“The chances are she will despise him,” interrupted Alix; ” I should.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I should approach you very differently,” said this profound tactician, growing interested in his own plan of attack and conquest. “For instance, I remember a woman once who boasted, like yourself, that she was not to be won; I pursued that woman for two years; I studied her mind, I crept into her imagination, and when I cried ‘Victory,’ I told her what I had done.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I left her!”</p>

<p>“You serpent!”</p>

<p>“She should not have defied me,” he laughed, enjoying the effect his recital produced on Alix, and taking her exclamation as a compliment to his prowess rather than otherwise.</p>

<p>“And you are a man that, after telling me such a story as this, dares to talk of love; you have not the faintest idea what it means.”</p>

<p>“Have I not?” he reiterated.</p>

<p>“No!” she returned vehemently; “the word is profaned when it passes your lips.”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed scornfully, and her lip quivered with suppressed indignation that he should have dared to approach her on such a subject.</p>

<p>He still kept up the semblance of a laugh, but suddenly his humour changed.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you shall love me, I swear it; and you shall marry me,” he said with determination.</p>

<p>“If I thought that possible,” she said, matching his humour now with her own, “I can imagine only one result.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“I should either kill myself or kill you.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” he laughed. “When a woman talks of killing, I know she has only one meaning for it, and I am not afraid of her heroics. Besides, our people never go in for scandals.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I never marry one of our people?</p>

<p>“You would not be such a fool as to marry any other,” he said quietly. “That is the last thing I have to fear, unless you marry a millionaire.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you would lose all your money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should lose eight thousand a-year; but suppose I found someone worth giving it up for?”</p>

<p>Adolph now looked up astonished. That anyone could be weighed in the balance against eight thousand a-year was a new view of the matter to him, unless he happened to have eighty thousand.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it; you will never be such a fool; and if you would, the man would not.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Alix, pursuing her advantage thoughtlessly, “I have formed a plan; I am determined to relieve myself of this bondage which limits my choice to one set of men.”</p>

<p>“What is your plan?”</p>

<p>“That is my secret.”</p>

<p>“What is it to do for you?”</p>

<p>“Give me, if not a fortune, at least independence.”</p>

<p>“But your family?”</p>

<p>“Are nothing to me; I don’t mean to consult them.”</p>

<p>“And when do you propose to begin your independence?” asked Adolph, now fairly anxious.</p>

<p>That also is my secret. I have not yet matured my scheme And now I really must go,” she said rising, leaving him to wonder what new freak she contemplated.</p>
