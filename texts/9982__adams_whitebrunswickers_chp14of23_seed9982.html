<p>“Well, Robinson,” said Stapleton, as they together with several other of the first-form boys, stood round the fire, in the interval between evening school and prayers,—”well Robinson, did you try Young’s bowling to-day?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Robinson, “and very strange bowling it is. In the first place it is left-handed, and in the next it twists from the off to the leg stump in a manner which is very likely to bother the batters. But his balls are not particularly well pitched, and
are the reverse of straight. He would do very well to put on as a change of bowling, but hardly as our regular bowler.”</p>
<p>“Well, but we must have him,” said Billy Waters. “Tyrrell will, of course, bowl at one end, and we are lucky to have him. But there is no one else in all our eleven who can bowl at all. It is Hobson’s choice, Young or nobody.”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose it is,” assented Robinson, “but if Heath, or Hall, or Gore, once get a sight of his bowling, they will make awfully long scores off it. The only chance will be their being out in the first over.”</p>
<p>“And is the day for the match fixed?” inquired the other.</p>
<p>“Yes, Brickbats made no objection to our going out on the Green next week, so of course we shall begin on Thursday.”</p>
<p>“Begin on Thursday! what the Alphabet match do you mean?” asked Gore, who came up at this moment, accompanied by Heath and Bishop.</p>
<p>“Yes, the leave has been given this afternoon, so I conclude the match will be played next Thursday; that has always been the custom, you knew.”</p>
<p>“To be sure,” interposed Heath, “it is the invariable practice to begin it on the first Thursday after the leave. Nothing is ever allowed to interfere with it; no illness, or accidental absence of any of the players, I mean. Is not that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” returned Robinson, “I don’t remember a case of that kind occurring, and it isn’t very likely; but I fancy it would be begun in any case, because if it was not got over early, other matches would be interfered with.”</p>
<p>“Just so,” said Heath. “”Well then, it is quite understood, that the Alphabet match is to be commenced on Thursday, the 13th, whatever may happen?”</p>
<p>Billy Waters laughed. “You are in a great hurry to beat us, Heath,” he said. “However, we may as well be put out of our pain as soon as possible, as the dentist tells a fellow, when he wants to draw an eye tooth; so I see no objection.”</p>
<p>“Nor I,” said Robinson, “let it be so settled if you like. By the bye, does any one know where Tyrrell is? I ought to ask him to bowl, I suppose. He may take huff if I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Tyrrell?” said Billy Waters. “Yes, he is at his desk there,” pointing as he spoke, to the further end of the school, where the boy in question was seated, half concealed by a pile of school books. “You had better not speak to him now. He has a letter to write before prayers, which he wants particularly to send by this night’s post. It will be as much as he will do to get it done, I expect. It only wants twenty minutes or so to prayers, and the letters go to the post immediately after they are over, you know.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Robinson, carelessly turning away, “I can speak to him to-morrow just as well.”</p>
<p>“Gore,” said Heath, drawing his confidant into a dark corner of the schoolroom, “do you guess what that letter is, which Tyrrell is writing over there?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned the boy addressed. “I make no doubt he is writing to his friends; his father probably, and asking him to send him the money to pay Giles. Don’t you think so yourself?”</p>
<p>“I have no doubt of it. But,” he lowered his voice to a whisper, “it won’t do to let that letter go. You see it is clear that Tyrrell had quite determined to play in the Alphabet match, and nothing we could have said would have prevented him. But this debt
to old Giles is a lucky chance, which we must not let slip. Unless he can get the money, ten to one he wont venture to show on the Green; and if he does, Giles would be pretty sure to carry out what he threatened, and then Tyrrell would be sent in, and not allowed probably to come out for a month.”</p>
<p>“No, that he wouldn’t,” exclaimed Gore, “even Brickbats would confine him to the playground for six weeks for it, and Rawbones, I’ll be bound, for two months.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” resumed Heath, “it is plain that we mustn’t let him get the needful before next Thursday. Now if the letter to his father goes, the chances are—I may say, the certainty is—that his father will send it. I know he is said to be poor, and a screw, and all that; but if he’s anything like his precious son, he won’t let Tyrrell remain in old Giles’s debt, whatever he may do. He’s a sight too proud for that, I guess.”</p>
<p>“But how are we to prevent him from writing?” inquired Gore, with an air of perplexity.</p>
<p>“I will tell you,” continued the other, lowering his voice still more. “You know the letters for the morning’s post lie all night in the letter box, which stands on the hall table. We must get the letter out some time in the course of the night. You need not
look so frightened, Gore. I don’t propose to steal the letter, but only to keep it back a post or two. Letters are constantly detained in the post, or miscarry. We can put it in again a day or two hence. It won’t even prevent Tyrrell from getting the money, or Giles
from being paid. They will only have to wait a little.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Gore, “but Tyrrell may get into a great row, if he hasn’t got the money to pay Giles next Thursday, and—”</p>
<p>“And what sort of a row will you and I get into, if we haven’t the money to pay Brackley, when the Alphabet match has been decided against us ?” retorted Heath. “No, no, Gore. It won’t do to be chicken-hearted. I tell you I have been making some inquiries since we came home, and I find things are even worse than I had suspected. Hunter says he
bowled out one or two of the best bats in the Nottingham eleven, and got a long score off the bowling of their crack player. It is quite as likely as not that he may win the match for the N’s himself; and they say this new chap, Young, can bowl better than any one supposed. We shall be beaten, unless we take care; and if we are, you and I will be in a most precious scrape, as you know well enough. I tell you again, we mustn’t let that letter go.”</p>
<p>“But how in the world are we to prevent it?” returned Gore, irritably. “Don’t you see he has nearly finished it already? He will give it to John Browning, and it will be in the post in another quarter of an hour.”</p>
<p>“I will prevent that at all events,” said Heath. “The letter shall not go to-night.” So saying, he picked up a dictionary, which was lying—as it is the wont of dictionaries belonging to schoolboys to lie—on the floor of the schoolroom—denuded of one cover, and despoiled of a third at least of its original contents. He threw this with so good an aim as to upset the leaden inkstand, which was standing before Tyrrell—scattering the ink in all directions, and almost covering the sheet of paper, which he was on the point of folding up. The letter was completely spoilt, and Tyrrell’s hands and coat sleeves, as well as his watch—which he had laid on the desk before him, in order to make sure of the time—were profusely bespattered by the sable shower. He started up with an angry exclamation, and glanced round to discover the author of the outrage; but the two conspirators had disappeared. What was to be done? He cast a hasty look at the watch, and saw that it still wanted ten minutes to prayer-time. It might still be just possible to re-write the letter. “Freddy,” he said to the little boy who had been sitting on a low stool at his side, and had fortunately escaped uninjured, “wipe the watch, and clear up the mess. I shall be back in a minute.” He ran out, washed his hands and coat sleeves, and then sate down to copy the earnest appeal to his father, which had cost him so much trouble and sorrow to compose. Gray sate by, holding the watch in his hand, and every now and then telling him how the minutes progressed. The hour had struck, but the Doctor chanced to be late that evening, and Tyrrell’s pen travelled rapidly over the paper. “It is finished, I declare,” he exclaimed, getting up to seal his missive at the candle. Alas! at that very moment the door opened, and the head-master, prayer-book in hand, made his appearance. Hastily handing the seal to Gray, Tyrrell made for the door, hoping to find time to deposit his letter and return before all the boys should have answered to their
names; but the stentorian tones of the doctor summoned him back, and the next minute the boys knelt down to prayers.</p>

<p>Tyrrell dropped his unlucky dispatch into the open mouth of the letter-box a quarter of an hour afterwards, and walked quietly upstairs to bed. The room he occupied was the smallest in the house, containing only three beds; one of which was tenanted, as the reader has heard, by Gray; and the other by a boy who was at the present time absent from
Brunswick House. Tyrrell seated himself on the end of his bed, and began slowly to undress. It was very vexatious, but it could not be helped, he thought, and it was no use fretting himself about it. After all it would only be the delay of one post. There would
still be ample time to receive an answer from his father before the arrival of the dreaded Thursday; and there could be no doubt that his father would send the money—no doubt at all. Of course he would be grieved and angry; he could not be otherwise. But Tyrrell had deserved that, and must bear it. He had promised, like poor little Freddy, that he
would never play wagers for money; but, unhappily, he had not, like little Freddy, kept his promise. He recalled the child’s words that afternoon, which seemed like a warning to him; though he was now fully persuaded that Gray had had no idea of applying them to him. He had been ungracious, he felt, to the boy, and would make up for it hereafter. It
was curious that Tyrrell, though he acknowledged inwardly the justice of the rebuke, which Gray’s words had conveyed to him, would still have been deeply offended if any such rebuke had been designed. He would allow himself to be benefited accidentally, and could even be grateful for the benefit; but he could not endure the idea of its having been intentional! Well, human nature is a strange mystery, and pride is one of its strangest affections; but we have no leisure to descant upon it now.</p>
<p>The time slipped away as Tyrrell reflected on the embarrassment of his present position, and he was on the point of getting into bed, when he discovered that
his watch was missing. A moment’s recollection assured him that he had intrusted it to Gray half an hour ago, while he was engaged in writing his letter. Doubtless he had it still in his pocket, and would bring it up with him presently. Well, he could ask
him for it when he came. He stepped into bed, and in two minutes was sound asleep, and it was early morning before he again unclosed his eyes.</p>
<p>The story now returns to Heath and Gore, who had not gone upstairs with the other boys after prayers, but had remained awhile in the schoolroom. This was no uncommon practice with the elder pupils, when they had any exercise to finish, or entertaining book to read. No one, therefore, was surprised to see Heath sit down at his desk to write a letter, nor
Gore engaged apparently in arranging his books. No sooner, however, had the last boy quitted the room, than Gore, closing his cupboard, came close to his companion’s side, and addressed him in a low tone.</p>
<p>“Do you really think there is so much danger of our losing the Alphabet match if Tyrrell plays?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Heath, “I have already told you so.”</p>
<p>“And you think that he will be free to play, unless his letter is prevented from going?”</p>
<p>“I make no doubt of it.”</p>
<p>“Then—then,” stammered Gore, “you mean really to—to—”</p>
<p>“To take the letter out of the box, and conceal it somewhere, hey? That is what you meant, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I suppose I did.”</p>
<p>“To be sure you did,” said Heath, coolly. “Well, Gore, I will answer your question more plainly than you asked it. I do not mean to take the letter out of the box, and conceal it somewhere.”</p>
<p>“You don’t! why I thought half an hour ago, you said just the contrary.”</p>
<p>“You thought right. Half an hour ago I did mean it, but I don’t now. Well, you want to know what has made me change my mind? I’ll tell you. I have found out since then, that by an odd chance I have won the sweepstakes of two pounds, for which I put in this morning. It seems that Middleton drew Crabtree for me, and Crabtree, we know, though they
don’t, is the winner.”</p>
<p>“Have you, really?” exclaimed Gore, “I congratulate you, I am sure. But still I don’t quitesee”—</p>
<p>“You don’t quite see what that has to do with our chance of losing the Alphabet match, if Tyrrell plays? It hasn’t anything to do with it; but it has a good deal to do with <i>me</i>. If we do lose that match, we shall have to pay two guineas a-piece to Brackley, and half an hour ago I didn’t know where to get two half-crowns. I was ready to run the risk of detaining Tyrrell’s letter, to get myself out of such a fix as that.
But now you see, come the worst to the worst, I shall be able to pay Brackley, and therefore I shall leave Tyrrell’s letter alone.”</p>
<p>“And who’s to pay the two guineas which <i>I</i> should owe to Brackley, supposing we lose?” asked Gore, anxiously. “I told you before that I can only raise half a guinea.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I am sure,” returned Heath, calmly. “Perhaps you may have a windfall like myself, and somebody give you two guineas, before the time comes.”</p>
<p>“You know there is no chance of that,” returned Gore, angrily.</p>
<p>“I don’t <i>know</i> it,” said Heath, “but no doubt the chances are against it. Well, Gore, you see you are in just the same hobble in which I was—in which we both were—before I heard of the sweepstakes.”</p>
<p>“Then I suppose you mean that I must take the letter out of the box, and keep it back for a few days, hey?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to <i>advise</i> you to do it, Gore. You must settle that for yourself.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Gore, after a few minutes of anxious thought, “how did you mean to go to work? The box is locked, and John keeps the key; so it can’t be opened, unless you have another key. And it is screwed to the table, so that one can’t shake the letters out; and it is very deep, and besides, the slit is so narrow, that no one could put their hand in to take anything out.”</p>
<p>“You have been giving it a pretty close examination, anyhow,” said Heath. “Well, I’ll tell you what I should have done, if you will promise not to tell any one.”</p>
<p>“I promise,” said Gore, “only be quick, for it is getting near the half hour.”</p>
<p>“Look here,” said Heath, opening his desk, and taking out a key without any wards, except one at the bottom, “that will open the letter-box. I know it will, because I once used it myself to get out a letter which I had put in, and afterwards did not wish to send.”</p>
<p>Gore took the key, though with manifest reluctance. “And when ought it to be done?” he said. “Now, at once?”</p>
<p>“What, when all the servants are about, and when Mother Brooksbank is on the point of going round to see the candles put out? Why, you must be crazy to think of it. No; wait till about three or four o’clock in the morning,—just daybreak, you know. Don’t go
down by candlelight; the candle might disturb someone. But as soon as you can see what you are doing, then is your time.”</p>
<p>“I shan’t be awake then,” said the wretched Gore. “Am I to lie awake all night on purpose?”</p>
<p>“Really I can’t tell you that: but if I should chance to be awake at the time, I’ll give you a shake. That’s ill I can promise.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Gore, disconsolately. “Are you coming up to bed now?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Heath, rising and putting into his pocket the letter which he had been writing. “I shan’t put this into the box,” he said, with a smile, “until to-morrow morning, or we shall have you fishing it out instead of the other.”</p>
<p>Gore made a lugubrious effort to smile in return, and began slowly mounting the staircase.</p>
<p>“Stupid muff!” muttered Heath to himself, as he followed him. “I must keep an eye upon him in the morning, or he won’t do it after all. It will be two guineas out of my pocket if he doesn’t; and besides, I mean to pay Master Tyrrell out for his insolence. Yes, yes—I’ll take care he does it.”</p>
<p>The early gray of an April morning was beginning to dapple the sky, when Gore crept cautiously out of bed. There had been no need for Heath to wake him. He had not closed his eyes for one moment throughout the entire night. And it was lucky, he thought, that
he had not been dependent upon him, for Heath was to all appearance sound asleep. Gore huddled on his things as quickly as possible, and slunk out of the room. The hall and staircase were not so well lighted as the bedroom, and he could hardly see his way
down stairs. Shivering from head to foot, partly with cold, partly with dread of detection, he crept stealthily down, until he stood in front of the letterbox. Conscience whispered loudly in his ear, warning him to desist while it was yet possible, but he stifled its remonstrances, and taking the key which Heath had given him, thrust it into the lock. At this moment a sound, something resembling a sigh or a suppressed exclamation, from some one apparently close at hand, struck on his ear. He drew back in a paroxysm of alarm, and looked nervously round him in all directions; fearing to discover some lurking
witness of his guilt, or to hear the voice of some concealed accuser. But all was silent, and the hall, so far as he could perceive, entirely empty. He took heart from the very extremity of his fears, and again applying the key to the lock, drew from the box the
only letter which it appeared to contain. A hurried glance assured him that it was the one of which he was in search. With a sigh of relief he thrust it into his pocket, and was turning round to quit the spot, when he saw by the dim morning light, a figure swiftly
but silently descending the stairs, and holding up its finger with a warning gesture. His heart leaped into his mouth, and he would have screamed aloud, if he had not perceived at that moment, that this spectral visitant was Heath.</p>
<p>“Hush!” whispered the latter, as he came closer to him, “follow me as quietly as you can.”</p>
<p>Gore complied, too much amazed to answer. Heath passed through the door which led through the dining-hall to the schoolroom, and carefully shutting it after Gore, locked it, and took out the key. He then went slowly through the dining-room, looking carefully
round him on every side. Having completed the survey of this room, he proceeded onwards to the door which opened on to the passage between the school and dining rooms; right and left of which lay the studies of the two senior ushers. This door again Heath locked behind him. He next proceeded to make a close examination of the studies, and finding these also empty, moved on to the schoolroom. Gore had by this time recovered himself so far, as to ask his companion for some explanation of this strange proceeding; but he received no other answer than a peremptory order to hold his tongue and follow him.</p>
<p>The schoolroom was to all appearance untenanted like the others; but Heath, who knew that the door at the further end was locked on the outside, was convinced that the object of which he was in quest was to be discovered here. Stationing Gore at the upper door, through which they had entered, he made a minute examination of the desks and cupboards;
and at length, to Gore’s astonishment, drew forth a small, thin figure, wrapped in a flannel dressing-gown, which had been crouching behind an open door. It was Freddy Gray.</p>
<p>Heath caught him by the throat, for he saw that the little boy was going to cry for help. “Hold your tongue,” he said in a low, distinct voice, “or it will be the worse for you. No harm shall be done you if you are quiet, but if you attempt to make a row, I’ll
strangle you. There now,” he resumed after a minute, observing that his threat had taken effect, “you have recovered your senses; now tell me what were you doing here at this time of night?”</p>
<p>“Tyrrell gave me his watch to take care of,” said Gray, trembling from head to foot, “and I forgot to take it up with me, when I went to bed last night.”</p>
<p>“What made you come down for it at this hour of the morning?” asked the other, incredulously.</p>
<p>“Tyrrell woke about half an hour ago, and asked me for it. He said he must have it at once now, or it would be too late to wind it up in another hour.”</p>
<p>“Where is the watch?” asked the other.</p>
<p>“Here,” said Freddy, putting his hand into the pocket of his dressing-gown, and drawing it out.</p>
<p>“Umph,” muttered Heath, “that looks as though his story were true. And so you came down to fetch it, did you?” he said aloud. “Now tell me another thing, and if you deceive me, I shall be sure to find it out, and will thrash you till I can’t stand over you. What made you look through the little window of the hall door, as you were coming back?”</p>
<p>“I—I thought I heard a noise in the hall,” said Gray.</p>
<p>“You heard a noise in the hall, and you looked to see if there was any one there? Now tell me, what <i>did</i> you see? Tell me the truth, mind, or you will repent it.”</p>
<p>“I saw—a boy—Gore here,”—faltered Freddy. “I saw him put a key or something into the letter-box, and take out Tyrrell’s letter.”</p>
<p>“Tyrrell’s letter!” exclaimed Heath, forgetting his caution in his suspicion and alarm; “how could you have known it was Tyrrell’s letter?”</p>
<p>“I saw him put one into the box last night, and there seemed to be only one letter.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that was it, was it?” said Heath, somewhat relieved, “you did not see,—you didn’t fancy you could read the direction on it?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not; it was too far off, and too dark, for that.”</p>
<p>“Just so. Well, Freddy, you have told me the truth, and I am pleased with you. But you have made quite a mistake. It wasn’t Tyrrell’s letter that Gore took out. If Tyrrell put one in, no doubt it is safe there now. It was a letter which I had written, and there was a wager between Gore and me as to whether it would go by to-morrow’s post, or not. Look here, you see this is it,” and as he spoke he drew forth the letter which, it will be remembered, he had himself written overnight, and which was addressed to F. Brackley, Esq., H.M.’s —th Regiment of Hussars, Barracks, Croydon. “This is the letter, you see,
Freddy. And now you must promise to say nothing about this, because, though it is only a joke between Gore and me, it would get him into great trouble, if it were told to the masters. They wouldn’t understand that it was only a joke. Will you promise to say
nothing about it?”</p>
<p>“You are sure Tyrrell’s letter is safe?” asked Gray, doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Quite safe, isn’t it, Gore?” said Heath, with a wink at his associate.</p>
<p>“As safe as possible,” returned the latter.</p>
<p>“Well then, I will promise,” said Gray. “If it was only a joke between you and Gore, there would be no harm in that, I suppose, and I shouldn’t like to get any one into trouble.”</p>
<p>“That is a good-natured little chap,” said Heath. “I will always be kind to you, if you keep your word.”</p>
<p>“And if you don’t, young’un,” interposed Gore, “I’ll give you such a licking, as you will remember to your dying day.”</p>
<p>“I always keep my word,” said Freddy, quietly; and Heath having unlocked the doors, they all three returned to their bedrooms.</p>
