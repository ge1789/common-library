<title>Chapter 3 of The Pharisees by Edwards</title>

<p>
By the first post, on the following morning, Guy received a letter. It was from Star, and he read it in his bedroom,
‘the master’s room,’ which oppressed him already with its grandeur, and seemed to dull his senses to drowsiness with
its air of overpowering luxury.

‘Guy, My Husband,—<br>
‘Notwithstanding your prohibition, I am going now to make one more (the last) effort to induce you to see things as
they are—to persuade you to save yourself, while there is yet time. Will you think once again before I join you
over our conversation on the day we left the dear old hut? Think, Guy, of the life which lies before you, and the
part I must, in the nature of things, play in it. Argue as you will, my husband, I shall be the proverbial millstone
which, hanging around your neck, will drag you down at every upward step, as you try to take it. Will your people,
your neighbors, your friends, ever look upon me as one of themselves? You know they will not. And knowing this, does
not your common sense tell you that you will share my proscription? How, then, are you to attain that political and
social greatness which, even in exile, has been the dream of your most ambitious spirit? Everything is within your
reach now—or it would be, were I not there to drag you back. And consider what a position this is for me! Why, the
pain of separation from you would be as nothing to it. Dear Guy, whilst there is time, let me do as I proposed. Let me
send the
<!-- NOTE: at this point the numbers “4—2” are written at the bottom of the page, center-right justified. I still can’t tell what they are for -->
boy to you, for I have no right to stand in the way of his social advancement, and let me turn back to the only home
I have ever known, and to the friends, who have learnt from knowledge of me, to believe in and love me. You know that
they will receive me with open hearts; you have nothing to fear for my future, and you have everything to hope for
your own. And for our boy! have you considered that I shall stand in his way, as I shall stand in yours, to shut
you both out from that society in which it is your right and your duty to move—your duty to the position which you
are called upon to maintain, because of all that depends upon it and is inseparable from it. If I am not with you,
your people will take the boy by the hand readily enough, and show him the way, in which he should go, to be as his
forefathers have been before him.’
</p>
</div>

<p>
‘God forbid!’ Guy said aloud, crushing the letter angrily; then, opening it again, he went on reading.
</p>
<!-- line break -->
<p>
‘I confess that I know nothing of the virtues required to make an English country gentleman; almost anything else I
might have undertaken to do for him honestly, but not this. And you know even less, Guy, for your ambition is,
forgive my saying it, for yourself alone. Only I have not even ambition.
</p>
<p>
‘Oh, Guy, believe me, if I had foreseen the destiny which was to be yours, I would never have done you the huge
wrong of marrying you. It was not my wish at any time, as you know; for somehow, even in our poverty and obscurity,
I felt that a woman standing towards a man as I to you, who binds him to her with a chain which the law, and not
his affection, makes unbreakable, does him a wrong which, sooner or later, he is sure to feel and resent. But then
you argued with me, Guy, and your argument was that only in the world of riches and fashion would a man be taught
to feel that he had committed a sin in marrying the woman who had given herself into his keeping. And for you there
was no such world, no such society; it had already cast you out, and I only was left to make your life. And so, at
last, you argued me into marriage. Regrets are futile, now; what is done cannot be undone. But it can be corrected.
I can go back to Adelaide, to the old life, and you can accomplish your new one at home. I can live, yes, and be
happy—by-and-by—in the reflected light of your prosperity which, of course, you will tell me by letter, for I
could not give up all share in your life, Guy. If I have letters from you, I can be happy in our separation—far
happier, I swear to you, than living with you and seeing, at every moment of our lives, that I am standing in the
way of your prosperity, and of your success, which, in the end, means of your happiness. For I know you better than
you know yourself, my husband, and I am certain that, struggle against it as you may, you will regret the decision
that brought me to Oldcastle. Don’t, Guy, don’t do me this wrong; let me go, while your love for me is still warm
and undiminished. Let me feel that I have never wronged you, and that all your remembrance of me is of the good I
have done you in the years of your suffering and exile. It is enought for me—let it be so for you also.
</p>
<p>
‘Guy, before you take this last irretrievable step, pause and think! Think of all that lies before you and me!
Think of my position at Oldcastle. My story known—all the incidents of my former life learnt as a lesson, with no
single paragraph omitted! And, then, the people who have learned it!—have you not often told me what they are?—did
you not yourself christen them Pharisees, because of their self-righteousness and bigotry? Can you teach them
charity, or even mercy? Never, I tell you, never! But they will teach you to repent!
</p>
<p>
‘I can say no more. If, in spite of my remonstrance, you insist on my coming to join you, I am bound to obey, and
if I come, God knows that it shall be from no lack of goodwill on my part to conciliate your family, for your sake,
that they shall turn their backs upon me. You have always credited me with cleverness—it shall be used to the
utmost to compel them, for your sake, to receive me amongst them. But my last words are—it will be better for
both if I return to Australia.
</p>
<div>
<p>
‘Good-night, my own.<br>
<!-- right justified, small caps -->
‘Your Star.’
</p>
</div>
<p>
‘How coldly she writes,’ he said to himself, folding the letter; ‘as if it would cost her nothing to separate herself
from me, when I know that a year would see her dead of misery. Star apart from me! She could not endure it—neither
could I. If, in the days to come, some part of us must fall to the ground, let it be my miserable ambition. But they
will receive her,’ he said confidently; ‘they must; I can force them to it; I have all the power of the county in
my hands; I am the master of Oldcastle.’
</p>
<p>
Then he sat down and wrote—
</p>
<div>
<p>
<!-- Address and date right justified, small text. 'My dear child' is in small caps, paragraph is double indented -->
‘Oldcastle, May 2.
</p>
<p>
‘My dear child,—
</p>
<p>
‘You have said all this before; why should you think it will take effect now? Have you ever known me change? Our
people leave Oldcastle to-morrow, and I shall arrange for your coming on Friday, but will write again.
</p>
<p>
‘My mother has expressed her intention to receive you as one of the family, and you may rest assured that where
she leads, others will follow. So put aside your fears, Star, my own, and come to me with your bright face and
your brighter spirit unclouded by idle imaginings.<br>
<!-- small caps, right justified -->
‘Your Tyrant.’
</p>
</div>
<p>
Star always called him her tyrant, when her heart warmed most towards him.
</p>
<p>
Then Guy, having enclosed the letter in an envelope and directed it, set out to carry it himself to the village office.
</p>
<p>
It was early summer, as, after eight years of exile, he walked once more through the well known lanes. Oldcastle
village lay in front of him on the hill; it was all a part of his own estate, and the people all called him master.
Away beyond the village, to the right and left of it, were neighbouring estates with their farms, and parks, and
preserves; but not one in all the county could compare with Oldcastle, either in extent, or beauty, or richness
of produce. Oldcastle had been cultivated for generations, and tended as the one immortal child of every succeeding
parent. It had not changed ownership for centuries, nor passed out of the direct line of inheritance. The Oldcastle
tree had been rich in branches always, and it was one additional grievance against Guy that he had failed to
support this family tradition of productiveness. But it was of course, they said; he neither hunted, nor shot,
nor fished, nor farmed, and how was it possible for a creature so effete, to raise up heirs to Oldcastle? His one
miserable little son, they said, would be sure to take after himself, and be found wanting in all the manly virtues
of muscular strength, animal courage, and hardihood. They attached no value in Oldcastle and the county to mental
strength or brain-power; these were not reckoned servants worthy of their hire, and their possessor had no more to
boast than the possessor of mere personal beauty. Guy was a scholar and a philosopher, but this availed him nothing
in the eyes of Oldcastle, where the size of a man’s muscles, not his brains, was the standard of his power.
</p>
<p>
On his road to the post-office, Guy Oldcastle was planning still for his career.
</p>
<p>
‘Of course they will not oppose me,’ he told himself, thinking of the impending election; ‘I shall come in as the
others have done, by a tacit and universal acknowledgement of my right to the seat. There will be some question
of my late avowed principles, no doubt, but they can’t afford to be overscrupulous, they will be ready enough
to take my word for it that to-day I am a staunch Tory, of which my prosperity is a guarantee! Moreover, I am
necessary to them. I happen to have more money than anyone else in the county, which is a weapon they dare not
despise. Once having secured my seat, there will be no difficulties in the way of obtaining all the rest. I
have some belief now in the theory of predestination, which has hiherto been a little difficult of acceptance. For
me, certainly, things have been arranged to a nicety. Life has a meaning for me at last—accomplishment!’
</p>
<p>
But he had forgotten Star.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Oldcastle, with her daughters and the cousins, left Oldcastle, as they had arranged, early on the morning
following Guy’s arrival. It was in vain that he asked them not to hurry away, as if he had turned them out. Mrs.
Oldcastle would not stop a moment longer than her ‘duty’ compelled her. She gave Guy an account of her stewardship,
although he required none of her, and she insisted on herself laying everything in the new master’s hands. She
saw that everywhere things were in order for his taking possession, and then she resigned with cold, calm dignity.
She did not forget to offer him her best wishes for his future prosperity; which, as it meant the prosperity of the
house of Oldcastle, came from her heart, or whatever stood her in the place of that organ. She said to him
everything that could be required of kindness, but she said it all in the mechanical, learnt-lesson way, which
was habitual to her.
</p>
<p>
As she was stepping into the carriage to drive away to the Dower House, she turned and addressed Guy.
</p>
<p>
‘I shall call on Mrs. Oldcastle,’ she said graciously, ‘when she has had time to grow somewhat used to her surroundings.
No doubt she would rather I left her undisturbed for a week. I shall be glad to see my grandson.’
</p>
<p>
‘My grandson’ again; he was an Oldcastle, do you see, and a part of herself, and she was not going to visit the
sins of his mother upon his head, lest they should reflect upon her own!
</p>
<p>
Guy answered her that she could call when, or as soon as, she liked. ‘Star is not afflicted with shyness’ he said,
and she deigning him no answer, or not having ‘taken in’ his remark, drove away side by side with Tiny, and with
Martha, the elder sister, sitting uncomplainingly opposite. Everything, even a front seat in the carriage, must be
yielded to ‘poor dear Tiny.’
</p>
<p>
The Dower House was a part of the Oldcastle estate, and lying within the park enclosure, yet it was a mile distant
from the old house. It was a comparatively modern building, large and comfortable, and standing in handsome grounds
of its own, with farms, conservatories, and tennis lawns; in a word, supplied with every modern luxury.
</p>
<p>
But it was not Oldcastle, and the mistress of the Dower House was not the mistress of Oldcastle. She was that
much despised dog who, having had its day, creeps into a corner where those of its ancient friends who have
pity upon it come sometimes and pat it on the head benignly, calling it ‘Poor old Bess,’ half pityingly, half
scornfully. For ‘Bess,’ her day being over, is no use to them now.
</p>
<p>
All this Mrs. Oldcastle felt with more than the bitterness of death, but she was proud to excess, and her pride
forbade her to show to any human being, even to her eldest daughter—who was almost a part of herself—the wound
which seemed to have cut her very life-strings asunder.
</p>
<p>
She was not a degree more moved than usual as she drove away from Oldcastle, bowing a gracious good-bye to the
servants and tenants who had collected in the hall and on the terrace and among the park drive, to bid her God
speed. They had not loved her, these dependents—not one amongst them could raise a tear for her departure; but
they had always respected her, because she respected herself, and she had never failed in her duty towards them.
Martha they would have loved, had she allowed them, but always, just as a love was growing for the woman who had
come to them in sickness and nursed them, or in trouble and helped them, working with them and for them, till the
need was over, this woman would show them that she had been a martyr for their sakes; and so the new-born love was
killed at its awakening. Tiny, too, was good to them in a fitful, unbalanced way, taking up favourites, loading
them with benefits, then dropping them again with most unreasoning caprice. She had always a favourite plaything in
the shape of a child from among the tenantry, and this child must be constantly at the house playing around her
sofa. Sometimes she would teach it to read or write or work, with her usual fitful energy, and she would correct
it or spoil it according to the mood which dominated her. But three months saw the birth and death of every good
work Tiny took in hand. Nevertheless, the people had a sort of tenderness for her, as for a spoiled child, to
whose faults it behoved them to be lenient for the sake of some supposed good which lay hidden in her somewhere.
</p>
<p>
As to Jo, she was a stranger to most of them. Only the gamekeepers knew her, and the kennel-keepers and the
stablemen; but the wives and the children of these same keepers were of less account to Jo than the dogs or
the horses of which they had charge.
</p>
<p>
But if Jo did no good to anyone, be it remembered of her that she did no harm, or far less harm to her fellow-creatures
than did others of her family. Jo’s life was filled, and her thoughts occupied, with the perfections and the
imperfections of her horses and her dogs; and she troubled herself not at all over the affairs of her neighbours.
She was even disposed to allow some possible virtue in Star since she heard from Guy that his wife was a most
perfect horsewoman. Not that Jo thought about it, one way or the other; since Star, together with women in
general, stood utterly outside the pale of her existence. They were not dogs, you see, or horses!
</p>
<p>
Phyllis Orme and her brother left Oldcastle for the Dower House with the rest.
</p>
<p>
But Errol remained behind at Oldcastle.
</p>
<p>
He had said to Guy, with his usual quiet self-assertion, ‘If you want me to go, I’ll go; but so long as the house
is empty and I don’t interfere with you, I should like to stay on at Oldcastle.’
</p>
<p>
And Guy had told him that, until Star came, he might remain; but that afterwards, if she made any objection to his
presence, he would have to go. He was content with this permission, feeling somehow confident that Star would not
object to his presence.
</p>
<p>
‘But have you no pride, Errol?’ his mother had urged, when he told her of his intention to remain at Oldcastle.
‘Would you thrust yourself upon Guy, who, as you know, hates us all, and is glad to get us out of his way. Of
course, his natural feeling of delicacy, which, as an Oldcastle, he cannot help possessing, notwithstanding the
late associations of his life, will not let him appear to turn you out of the house; but your feelings of delicacy
ought equally to have forbidden you to desire—and, above all, to ask—to remain in it. More especially as you
know nothing of what may be Mrs. Oldcastle’s wishes on the subject.’
</p>
<p>
‘If she doesn’t wish me to stay she will tell me to go.’ Errol had answered; ‘or if she won’t speak, I shall soon
see what her wishes are. It’s never difficult to read a woman, mother—that’s to say, if she’s young enough and
pretty enough to make the reading worth one’s while. Star and I are bound to be friends,’ he added confidently,
having no fear of his mother’s displeasure in this matter.
</p>
<p>
He had constituted himself from the beginning Star’s champion, perhaps because he knew she had been an actress, and
actresses had a special attraction for him, just then. He was passing through the various phases of stage fever,
which is wont to attack, with more or less virulence, the youth of the present day.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Oldcastle did not attempt to argue further with him. Already she had proved on several occasions how futile
were her arguments or persuasions against his quiet, persistent self-will. A year ago, she and his father had been
able to compel him to obedience because they held the pursestrings; and want of money was in their opinion a sure
corrective of vice. But on the death of his father, Errol, being of age, had come into his independence; and he
was now proceeding at will to put into practice, after the manner of youth, the Epicurean theory of pleasure and
happiness But often, very often, Errol would give way to his mother’s wishes, and humour her prejudices; because to
see other people happy was an indispensable requisite for his own happiness, and because it was almost physically
impossible for him to inflict suffering anywhere—a virtue which in him amounted almost to a weakness, since it
interfered sometimes with the strict honesty of his conduct in the matter of some of his smaller social dealings.
</p>
<p>
Martha was much troubled about Errol’s future. He had been her special charge—her pet, her baby. She had nursed
him and taught him, and struggled unceasingly to force on him that amount of principle which is to withstand all
temptation. But he had not profited by her teaching; he had a larger number of ‘vicious propensities’ than even
the weakness of youth could excuse, and many and bitter were the tears poor Martha shed over Errol’s often
repeated sins. But the greatest amongst them was his love of London, and London society, and London amusements, and
his insistence on spending three months at least of every year with his cousins the Ormes, in what poor Martha called,
and religiously believed to be, ‘riotous living’ and ‘dissipation.’
</p>
<p>
Errol had only returned to Oldcastle a week ago, because he had heard that Star was coming home! He was now waiting
anxiously for her arrival at Oldcastle on the appointed Friday.
