<title>Chapter 8 of Trollope’s Can You Forgive Her</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- chapter title is "Mr. Cheesacre." -->
<p>Yarmouth is not a happy place for a picnic. A picnic should be held
among green things. Green turf is absolutely an essential. There
should be trees, broken ground, small paths, thickets, and hidden
recesses. There should, if possible, be rocks, old timber, moss, and
brambles. There should certainly be hills and dales,—on a small
scale; and above all, there should be running water. There should be
no expanse. Jones should not be able to see all Greene’s movements,
nor should Augusta always have her eye upon her sister Jane. But the
spot chosen for Mr. Cheesacre’s picnic at Yarmouth had none of the
virtues above described. It was on the seashore. Nothing was visible
from the site but sand and sea. There were no trees there and nothing
green;—neither was there any running water. But there was a long,
dry, flat strand; there was an old boat half turned over, under which
it was proposed to dine; and in addition to this, benches, boards,
and some amount of canvas for shelter were provided by the liberality
of Mr. Cheesacre. Therefore it was called Mr. Cheesacre’s picnic.</p>

<p>But it was to be a marine picnic, and therefore the essential
attributes of other picnics were not required. The idea had come from
some boating expeditions, in which mackerel had been caught, and
during which food had been eaten, not altogether comfortably, in the
boats. Then a thought had suggested itself to Captain Bellfield that
they might land and eat their food, and his friend Mr. Cheesacre had
promised his substantial aid. A lady had surmised that Ormesby sands
would be the very place for dancing in the cool of the evening. They
might “Dance on the sand,” she said, “and yet no footing seen.” And
so the thing had progressed, and the picnic been inaugurated.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Cheesacre’s picnic undoubtedly. Mr. Cheesacre was to supply
the boats, the wine, the cigars, the music, and the carpenter’s work
necessary for the turning of the old boat into a banqueting saloon.
But Mrs. Greenow had promised to provide the eatables, and enjoyed as
much of the <em>éclat</em> as the master of the festival. She had
known Mr. Cheesacre now for ten days and was quite intimate with him. He
was a stout, florid man, of about forty-five, a bachelor, apparently much
attached to ladies’ society, bearing no sign of age except that he
was rather bald, and that grey hairs had mixed themselves with his
whiskers, very fond of his farming, and yet somewhat ashamed of it
when he found himself in what he considered to be polite circles. And
he was, moreover, a little inclined to seek the honour which comes
from a well-filled and liberally-opened purse. He liked to give a man
a dinner and then to boast of the dinner he had given. He was very
proud when he could talk of having mounted, for a day’s hunting, any
man who might be supposed to be of higher rank than himself. “I had
Grimsby with me the other day,—the son of old Grimsby of Hatherwick,
you know. Blessed if he didn’t stake my bay mare. But what matters? I
mounted him again the next day just the same.” Some people thought he
was soft, for it was very well known throughout Norfolk that young
Grimsby would take a mount wherever he could get it. In these days
Mrs. Greenow had become intimate with Mr. Cheesacre, and had already
learned that he was the undoubted owner of his own acres.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do for me,” she had said to him, “to be putting myself
forward, as if I were giving a party myself, or anything of that
sort;—would it now?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not. But you might come with us.”</p>

<p>“So I will, Mr. Cheesacre, for that dear girl’s sake. I should never
forgive myself if I debarred her from all the pleasures of youth,
because of my sorrows. I need hardly say that at such a time as this
nothing of that sort can give me any pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said Mr. Cheesacre, with solemn look.</p>

<p>“Quite out of the question.” And Mrs. Greenow wiped away her tears.
“For though as regards age I might dance on the sands as merrily as
the best of <span class="nowrap">them—”</span></p>

<p>“That I’m sure you could, Mrs. Greenow.”</p>

<p>“How’s a woman to enjoy herself if her heart lies buried?”</p>

<p>“But it won’t be so always, Mrs. Greenow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Greenow shook her head to show that she hardly knew how to answer
such a question. Probably it would be so always;—but she did not
wish to put a damper on the present occasion by making so sad a
declaration. “But as I was saying,” continued she—“if you and I do
it between us won’t that be the surest way of having it come off
nicely?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cheesacre thought that it would be the best way.</p>

<p>“Exactly so;—I’ll do the meat and pastry and fruit, and you shall do
the boats and the wine.”</p>

<p>“And the music,” said Cheesacre, “and the expenses at the place.” He
did not choose that any part of his outlay should go unnoticed.</p>

<p>“I’ll go halves in all that if you like,” said Mrs. Greenow. But Mr..
Cheesacre had declined this. He did not begrudge the expense, but
only wished that it should be recognised.</p>

<p>“And, Mr. Cheesacre,” continued Mrs. Greenow. “I did mean to send the
music; I did, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t hear of it, Mrs. Greenow.”</p>

<p>“But I mention it now, because I was thinking of getting Blowehard to
come. That other man, Flutey, wouldn’t do at all out in the open
air.”</p>

<p>“It shall be Blowehard,” said Mr. Cheesacre; and it was Blowehard. Mrs.
Greenow liked to have her own way in these little things, though her
heart did lie buried.</p>

<p>On the morning of the picnic Mr. Cheesacre came down to Montpelier
Parade with Captain Bellfield, whose linen on that occasion certainly
gave no outward sign of any quarrel between him and his washerwoman.
He was got up wonderfully, and was prepared at all points for the
day’s work. He had on a pseudo-sailor’s jacket, very liberally
ornamented with brass buttons, which displayed with great judgement
the exquisite shapes of his pseudo-sailor’s duck trousers. Beneath
them there was a pair of very shiny patent-leather shoes, well
adapted for dancing on the sand, presuming him to be anxious of doing
so, as Venus offered to do, without leaving any footmarks. His
waistcoat was of a delicate white fabric, ornamented with very many
gilt buttons. He had bejewelled studs in his shirt, and yellow kid
gloves on his hands; having, of course, another pair in his pocket
for the necessities of the evening. His array was quite perfect, and
had stricken dismay into the heart of his friend Cheesacre, when he
joined that gentleman. He was a well-made man, nearly six feet high,
with dark hair, dark whiskers, and dark moustache, nearly black, but
of that suspicious hue which to the observant beholder seems always
to tell a tale of the hairdresser’s shop. He was handsome, too, with
well-arranged features,—but carrying, perhaps, in his nose some
first symptoms of the effects of midnight amusements. Upon the whole,
however, he was a nice man to look at—for those who like to look on
nice men of that kind.</p>

<p>Cheesacre, too, had adopted something of a sailor’s garb. He had on a
jacket of a rougher sort, coming down much lower than that of the
captain, being much looser, and perhaps somewhat more like a garment
which a possible seaman might possibly wear. But he was disgusted
with himself the moment that he saw Bellfield. His heart had been
faint, and he had not dared to ornament himself boldly as his friend
had done. “I say, Guss, you are a swell,” he exclaimed. It may be
explained that Captain Bellfield had been christened Gustavus.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about that,” said the captain; “my fellow sent me
this toggery, and said that it was the sort of thing. I’ll change
with you if you like it.” But Cheesacre could not have worn that
jacket, and he walked on, hating himself.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Mrs. Greenow had spoken with considerable
severity of Captain Bellfield’s pretensions when discussing his
character with her niece; but, nevertheless, on the present occasion
she received him with most gracious smiles. It may be that her
estimate of his character had been altered, or that she was making
sacrifice of her own feelings in consideration of Mr. Cheesacre, who
was known to be the captain’s intimate friend. But she had smiles for
both of them. She had a wondrous power of smiling; and could, upon
occasion, give signs of peculiar favour to half a dozen different
gentlemen in as many minutes. They found her in the midst of hampers
which were not yet wholly packed, while Mrs. Jones, Jeannette, and the
cook of the household moved around her, on the outside of the circle,
ministering to her wants. She had in her hand an outspread clean
napkin, and she wore fastened round her dress a huge coarse apron,
that she might thus be protected from some possible ebullition of
gravy, or escape of salad mixture, or cream; but in other respects
she was clothed in the fullest honours of widowhood. She had not
mitigated her weeds by half an inch. She had scorned to make any
compromise between the world of pleasure and the world of woe. There
she was, a widow, declared by herself to be of four months’ standing,
with a buried heart, making ready a dainty banquet with skill and
liberality. She was ready on the instant to sit down upon the baskets
in which the grouse pie had been just carefully inhumed, and talked
about her sainted lamb with a deluge of tears. If anybody didn’t like
it, that person—might do the other thing. Mr. Cheesacre and Captain
Bellfield thought that they did like it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Cheesacre, if you haven’t caught me before I’ve half done!
Captain Bellfield, I hope you think my apron becoming.”</p>

<p>“Everything that you wear, Mrs. Greenow, is always becoming.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk in that way when you know—; but never mind—we will
think of nothing sad to-day if we can help it. Will we, Mr..
Cheesacre?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no; I should think not;—unless it should come on to rain.”</p>

<p>“It won’t rain—we won’t think of such a thing. But, by the by,
Captain Bellfield, I and my niece do mean to send out a few things,
just in a bag you know, so that we may tidy ourselves up a little
after the sea. I don’t want it mentioned, because if it gets about
among the other ladies, they’d think we wanted to make a dressing of
it;—and there wouldn’t be room for them all; would there?”</p>

<p>“No; there wouldn’t,” said Mr. Cheesacre, who had been out on the
previous evening, inspecting, and perhaps limiting, the carpenters in
their work.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Mrs. Greenow. “But there won’t be any harm,
will there, Mr. Cheesacre, in Jeanette’s going out with our things?
She’ll ride in the cart, you know, with the eatables. I know
Jeannette’s a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“We shall be delighted to have Jeanette,” said Mr. Cheesacre.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, sir,” said Jeannette, with a curtsey.</p>

<p>“Jeannette, don’t you let Mr. Cheesacre turn your head; and mind you
behave yourself and be useful. Well; let me see;—what else is there?
Mrs. Jones, you might as well give me that ham now. Captain Bellfield,
hand it over. Don’t you put it into the basket, because you’d turn it
the wrong side down. There now, if you haven’t nearly made me upset
the apricot pie.” Then, in the transfer of the dishes between the
captain and the widow, there occurred some little innocent by-play,
which seemed to give offence to Mr. Cheesacre; so that that gentleman
turned his back upon the hampers and took a step away towards the
door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greenow saw the thing at a glance, and immediately applied
herself to cure the wound. “What do you think, Mr. Cheesacre,” said
she, “Kate wouldn’t come down because she didn’t choose that you
should see her with an apron on over her frock!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know why Miss Vavasor should care about my seeing
her.”</p>

<p>“Nor I either. That’s just what I said. Do step up into the
drawing-room; you’ll find her there, and you can make her answer for
herself.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t come down for me,” said Mr. Cheesacre. But he didn’t
stir. Perhaps he wasn’t willing to leave his friend with the widow.</p>

<p>At length the last of the dishes was packed and Mrs. Greenow went
up-stairs with the two gentlemen. There they found Kate and two or
three other ladies who had promised to embark under the protection of
Mrs. Greenow’s wings. There were the two Miss Fairstairs, whom Mrs.
Greenow had especially patronized, and who repaid that lady for her
kindness by an amount of outspoken eulogy which startled Kate by its
audacity.</p>

<p>“Your dear aunt!” Fanny Fairstairs had said on coming into the room.
“I don’t think I ever came across a woman with such genuine milk of
human kindness!”</p>

<p>“Nor with so much true wit,” said her sister Charlotte,—who had been
called Charlie on the sands of Yarmouth for the last twelve years.</p>

<p>When the widow came into the room, they flew at her and devoured her
with kisses, and swore that they had never seen her looking so well.
But as the bright new gloves which both the girls wore had been
presents from Mrs. Greenow, they certainly did owe her some affection.
There are not many ladies who would venture to bestow such gifts upon
their friends after so very short an acquaintance; but Mrs. Greenow
had a power that was quite her own in such matters. She was already
on a very confidential footing with the Miss Fairstairs, and had
given them much useful advice as to their future prospects.</p>

<p>And then was there a Mrs. Green, whose husband was first-lieutenant on
board a man-of-war on the West Indian Station. Mrs. Green was a quiet,
ladylike little woman, rather pretty, very silent, and, as one would
have thought, hardly adapted for the special intimacy of Mrs. Greenow.
But Mrs. Greenow had found out that she was alone, not very rich, and
in want of the solace of society. Therefore she had, from sheer
good-nature, forced herself upon Mrs. Green, and Mrs. Green, with much
trepidation, had consented to be taken to the picnic. “I know your
husband would like it,” Mrs. Greenow had said, “and I hope I may live
to tell him that I made you go.”</p>

<p>There came in also a brother of the Fairstairs girls, Joe Fairstairs,
a lanky, useless, idle young man, younger than them, who was supposed
to earn his bread in an attorney’s office at Norwich, or rather to be
preparing to earn it at some future time, and who was a heavy burden
upon all his friends. “We told Joe to come to the house,” said Fanny
to the widow, apologetically, “because we thought he might be useful
in carrying down the cloaks.” Mrs. Greenow smiled graciously upon Joe,
and assured him that she was charmed to see him, without any
reference to such services as those mentioned.</p>

<p>And then they started. When they got to the door both Cheesacre and
the captain made an attempt to get possession of the widow’s arm. But
she had it all arranged. Captain Bellfield found himself constrained
to attend to Mrs. Green, while Mr. Cheesacre walked down to the beach
beside Kate Vavasor. “I’ll take your arm, Mr. Joe,” said the widow,
“and the girls shall come with us.” But when they got to the boats,
round which the other comers to the picnic were already assembled, Mr.
Cheesacre,—although both the boats were for the day his own,—found
himself separated from the widow. He got into that which contained
Kate Vavasor, and was shoved off from the beach while he saw Captain
Bellfield arranging Mrs. Greenow’s drapery. He had declared to himself
that it should be otherwise; and that as he had to pay the piper, the
piper should play as he liked it. But Mrs. Greenow with a word or two
had settled it all, and Mr. Cheesacre had found himself to be
powerless. “How absurd Bellfield looks in that jacket, doesn’t he?”
he said to Kate, as he took his seat in the boat.</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I thought it was so very pretty and becoming for
the occasion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cheesacre hated Captain Bellfield, and regretted more than ever
that he had not done something for his own personal adornment. He
could not endure to think that his friend, who paid for nothing,
should carry away the honours of the morning and defraud him of the
delights which should justly belong to him, “It may be becoming,”
said Cheesacre; “but don’t you think it’s awfully extravagant?”</p>

<p>“As to that I can’t tell. You see I don’t at all know what is the
price of a jacket covered all over with little brass buttons.”</p>

<p>“And the waistcoat, Miss Vavasor!” said Cheesacre, almost solemnly.</p>

<p>“The waistcoat I should think must have been expensive.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dreadful! and he’s got nothing, Miss Vavasor; literally nothing.
Do you know,”—and he reduced his voice to a whisper as he made this
communication,—“I lent him twenty pounds the day before yesterday; I
did indeed. You won’t mention it again, of course. I tell you,
because, as you are seeing a good deal of him just now, I think it
right that you should know on what sort of a footing he stands.” It’s
all fair, they say, in love and war, and this small breach of
confidence was, we must presume, a love stratagem on the part of Mr.
Cheesacre. He was at this time smitten with the charms both of the
widow and of the niece, and he constantly found that the captain was
interfering with him on whichever side he turned himself. On the
present occasion he had desired to take the widow for his share, and
was, upon the whole, inclined to think that the widow was the more
worthy of his attentions. He had made certain little inquiries within
the last day or two, the answers to which had been satisfactory.
These he had by no means communicated to his friend, to whom, indeed,
he had expressed an opinion that Mrs. Greenow was after all only a
flash in the pan. “She does very well pour passer le temps,” the
captain had answered. Mr. Cheesacre had not quite understood the exact
gist of the captain’s meaning, but had felt certain that his friend
was playing him false.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it to be mentioned again, Miss Vavasor,” he continued.</p>

<p>“Such things should not be mentioned at all,” Kate replied, having
been angered at the insinuation that the nature of Captain
Bellfield’s footing could be a matter of any moment to her.</p>

<p>“No, they shouldn’t; and therefore I know that I’m quite safe with
you, Miss Vavasor. He’s a very pleasant fellow, very; and has seen
the world,—uncommon; but he’s better for eating and drinking with
than he is for buying and selling with, as we say in Norfolk. Do you
like Norfolk, Miss Vavasor?”</p>

<p>“I never was in it before, and now I’ve only seen Yarmouth.”</p>

<p>“A nice place, Yarmouth, very; but you should come up and see our
lands. I suppose you don’t know that we feed one-third of England
during the winter months.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!”</p>

<p>“We do, though; nobody knows what a county Norfolk is. Taking it
altogether, including the game you know, and Lord Nelson, and its
watering-places and the rest of it, I don’t think there’s a county in
England to beat it. Fancy feeding one-third of all England and
Wales!”</p>

<p>“With bread and cheese, do you mean, and those sort of things?”</p>

<p>“Beef!” said Mr. Cheesacre, and in his patriotic energy he repeated
the word aloud. “Beef! Yes indeed; but if you were to tell them that
in London they wouldn’t believe you. Ah! you should certainly come
down and see our lands. The 7.45 <span class="smallcaps">a.m.</span>
train would take you through
Norwich to my door, as one may say, and you would be back by the 6.22
<span class="smallcaps">p.m.</span>” In this way he brought himself
back again into good-humour,
feeling, that in the absence of the widow, he could not do better
than make progress with the niece.</p>

<p>In the mean time Mrs. Greenow and the captain were getting on very
comfortably in the other boat. “Take an oar, Captain,” one of the men
had said to him as soon as he had placed the ladies. “Not to-day,
Jack,” he had answered. “I’ll content myself with being bo’san this
morning.” “The best thing as the bo’san does is to pipe all hands to
grog,” said the man. “I won’t be behind in that either,” said the
captain; and so they all went on swimmingly.</p>

<p>“What a fine generous fellow your friend, Mr. Cheesacre, is!” said the
widow.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is; he’s a capital fellow in his way. Some of these Norfolk
farmers are no end of good fellows.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose he’s something more than a common farmer. He’s visited
by the people about where he lives, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, in a sort of a way. The county people, you know, keep
themselves very much to themselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s of course. But his house;—he has a good sort of place,
hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes;—a very good house;—a little too near to the horse-pond
for my taste. But when a man gets his money out of the till, he
mustn’t be ashamed of the counter;—must he, Mrs. Greenow?”</p>

<p>“But he could live like a gentleman if he let his own land, couldn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon how a gentleman wishes to live.” Here the privacy
of their conversation was interrupted by an exclamation from a young
lady to the effect that Charlie Fairstairs was becoming sick. This
Charlie stoutly denied, and proved the truth of her assertion by her
behaviour. Soon after this they completed their marine adventures,
and prepared to land close to the spot at which the banquet was
prepared.</p>
