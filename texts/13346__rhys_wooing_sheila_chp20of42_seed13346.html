<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- CHAPTER XX<br> THE HONEY FAIR -->
<p>
That same morning old Theresa and Sheila had been up with the dawn. They had borrowed a small grey ass and creels to take their honey to the autumn fair of Gurt.
</p>
<p>
He was an old ass and very cunning, said his owner, and was in the habit of playing on every woman he had to do with. So they must rise early and put a nail in the end of a stick if they wanted to be in time for the fair.
</p>
<p>
The honey was in two great earthen pots, and they lifted Theresa’s into one creel and Sheila’s into another, and covered each with a fair white cloth.
</p>
<p>
As they were going to the town, Sheila must wear her long black dress, and her boots too; but as she had the ass to drive, she could not take the wide black shawl; so she loosely tied on a little drab-coloured head-shawl and let it fall back on her shoulders.
</p>
<p>
It was a very cheerful young face that looked up to the sky to discover the promise of the day. Old Theresa, too, was in fine spirits; it was a good honey year, none better. She trundled along behind Sheila and the ass in her handsome red cloak, the frilled cap under her little round hat of black straw shining as white as snow.
</p>
<p>
They got down the hill path and out along the road before the sun fairly rose; the air was fresh with an autumnal chill, and from twig to twig in the hedges hung a tapestry of spiders’ webs wonderfully beaded with dew.
</p>
<p>
Theresa had armed herself with a holly branch; then when the old grey ass desired to go home to his owner and went sideways across the road, looking at Sheila with a cautious eye, Theresa would correct him with a loud screetch and a blow from the holly branch.
</p>
<p>
In this way they got on very comfortably together a good piece of the road. Then the warm sun came up and, flashing through the hedges, turned the grey dew-drops to many-coloured flaming jewels. Soon it woke up flies or wasps from their sleep, and, smelling the sweet heather honey as it passed, they followed after Sheila in an increasing swarm.
</p>
<p>
Carts and donkeys laden with honey and butter and eggs began to overtake them, and Sheila and Theresa received many greetings and kind words, for in their slow travelling all the fair that took that way must pass them.
</p>
<p>
As they drew on to the town, the air was alive with the noise of men’s voices shouting, of the screaming of poultry and the squealing of pigs. They could hardly find a way to guide their ass and precious creels through the people to the great wall of the convent garden beneath which always sat the women with their eggs and butter and the honey of the autumn fair.
</p>
<p>
Theresa had secured a board and trestles, and they set out their two pots side by side and tethered the ass near by. So much business done, Theresa fell to talking at a great rate with the women right and left of her. Sheila found a block of wood for a seat and leaned back against the wall, excited and bewildered.
</p>
<p>
This was the first time she had been at a fair; her mother, come of a strict and respectable family herself, had never allowed her daughter even to the market; so that this was only the second time she had been to Gurt.
</p>
<p>
From her seat she looked across the wide sunny market-place, feeling somewhat forlorn, for Theresa was not of her blood; and then her talk was that of an old woman, and Sheila had the thoughts of a young girl who still fears the mysteries of life.
</p>
<p>
The market-place was fast filling, and her ears were almost deafened by the noise that rose up from the crowd. To her right, across the slated roofs of the better-class houses, she could see the Chapel Tower, in the shadow of which her parents were resting. Right across the market-place was the ancient Abbey of Gurt, showing now only a ruined arch or two shadowed in tree-tops that appeared above the edge of the hollow in which it had hidden secure during hundreds of years.
</p>
<p>
On the left hand, whitewashed cottages, their roofs of every shade from dun to gold, climbed up the slope.
</p>
<p>
On the far side of the market-place a man was putting his head out of a barrel and inviting the young men to take shots at it. In front of Sheila and a little distance off, a cheap Jack had pulled up his cart. He had raised a white canvas awning over it, and now he was shouting and dancing upon it in the middle of his wares.
</p>
<p>
The crowd grew thicker and the noise greater every moment; it seemed a good-humoured crowd and well clothed, the men in their grey-blue frieze, the women in their scarlet cloaks or petticoats, greeting, talking, and bargaining together.
</p>
<p>
Sheila had lived so lonely upon her hill that she knew little or nothing of what was in the public mind of the people. She had heard now and then a talk of the Protestant tithes; Theresa had told her a tale of how soldiers, horse and foot, had been sent into the next county to take a Catholic widow’s cow. But Sheila had lived too remote, and the signs of a secret discontent, shared here and there among little dark-faced groups, passed unnoticed by her.
</p>
<p>
As she gazed about her, the travelling merchant, having assembled a fine company about his cart by his antics, commenced business by dangling an article of clothing before their eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Look at this, now,” he shouted in a powerful roar, now using English, now Irish. “What do ye call this? I won’t make so bold as to name it, but I’ll just ask ye to look at the beauty of it. There’s cut for ye and patthern. Sure the red soldiers themselves don’t have a better shape to them than this, and no offence. How much? Six shillin’s? Ah, take shame to yourself. Will six shillin’s pay the Sheep that carried it, and the man that wove it, and the ship that took it over the say, and me for the trouble I’m at to improve yer appearance? Sure this is rale English. Eight shillin’s? Eight dhivils! Aren’t I after telling ye it’s rale English? None of your dirty Irish factory stuff, as thick as a board, that the girls is tired of beholdin’. Eight and six, nine shillin’s. Look at the check on it. Ten and six. Here ye are, me boy, and that ye may never repint it!”
</p>
<p>
And rolling up the article, in a moment he had sent the little bundle flying over the heads of the people in the direction of a bashful young peasant in the background.
</p>
<p>
Sheila was still smiling at the antics of the little black-browed man, when a sudden strange misgiving came upon her. It was like the rising of a cloud that darkens a sunny day. She felt as though some ill-wishing person were near, or as though she were somewhere evilly spoken of.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment she saw people’s heads all turning in one direction; some were laughing and others gaping. Sheila looked, and in the distance across the market-place she saw moving a strange purple-coloured dress. The people between hindered her view of the woman that wore it, and she had just stood up to look, when Theresa spoke in her ear.
</p>
<p>
“Sheila,” she said in a hurry, “I’m just goin’ round the fair, and it’ll not be wan minute before I’m back. I’ve sold me honey, pot and all, to Mrs. Muldoon, and I’d advise you to be lookin’ after your own in place of gapin’ about ye.”
</p>
<p>
There was a tone of sharp familiarity in Theresa’s voice, yet Sheila in her new unrealised anxiety took her by the sleeve, saying, “Oh, Theresa, why would ye leave me? See, now, I don’t know the place nor the people, nor yet how to sell the honey.”
</p>
<p>
Theresa looked cross.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t I tell ye I’ll be back in a minute?” said she. “To hear ye talk, annybody would think ye were a baby, and you nigh eighteen years old.”
</p>
<p>
Sheila took away her hand and drew up her head. “And look at here, now,” went on Theresa more kindly, “the wasps is something to frighten you. I never seen the like of them. They’re into the honey in spite of ye. Here’s for ye, now, and Mrs. Mulcahy’ll mind ye while I’m gone.” Thrusting a stick with a piece of leather on the end of it into Sheila’s hand, she went off hastily to join two other women, and Sheila was left alone.
</p>
<p>
With a beating heart she stood up by her big honey-pot, noticing for the first time the number of wasps that crawled upon the board and flew round about it, making a sharp hum that could be heard through the shouting of the fair.
</p>
<p>
Sheila looked down and up the row of honey-sellers, and there were all the women guarding their faces, while with coloured handkerchiefs and sticks like Sheila’s they struck away the swarm.
</p>
<p>
Sheila turned about to look for the Mrs. Mulcahy that Theresa had said was to mind her. She saw a little old woman with a witch-like look, untidy grey hair, and a long sharp nose. She was talking confidentially to a middle-aged farmer, while with a wry smile she laid out in patterns on her board the dead bodies of the wasps she had killed.
</p>
<p>
Sheila thought they seemed to be glancing at her as they talked, and felt still more uneasy. But that moment she caught sight again of the purple-clad figure moving through the fair, looking, so Sheila thought, like a princess out of a book.
</p>
<p>
She forgot her shyness and ran across to her neighbour.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mrs. Mulcahy!” she said, “look at the wonderful lady! Did you ever see the like of her before?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Mulcahy looked up sharply into Sheila’s innocent face without speaking. But the sharpness soon melted out under the glance of Sheila’s shining eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Lady?” she said, “and on foot in the fair in that dress? That’s no lady. Sure I lived ten years up at the Castle, and I can tell a lady be the kick of her skirt.”
</p>
<p>
Sheila stood still by Mrs. Mulcahy’s board and looked across at the purple-clad woman, whom she could see more plainly now. She was both stout and fall, and her dress of flowered puce muslin was covered with many strange frills; her tiny hat rode upon a mass of bright-coloured hair, and as she swam along she rolled her shoulders and laughed.
</p>
<p>
There were two gentlemen by her side, one a young officer in undress uniform, the other Sheila looked at with some anxiety; in a moment he turned and she saw it was Hawks. At the same moment he caught sight of her and, smiling widely, kissed his hand to her across the space between. Sheila turned pale. Mrs. Mulcahy and the farmer had both seen it, and it seemed to her they looked at her suspiciously. She was just going to beg Mrs. Mulcahy to take care of her honey and let her go away home by herself, when she felt a tap on her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
A stout motherly-looking country body had come up and wanted to taste Sheila’s honey, so she had to go and attend upon her and talk and offer her a piece of the comb, knocking away the wasps that swarmed about it; but all the time her heart within her was fluttering with anxiety lest Hawks should make his way in her direction.
</p>
<p>
“Beautiful honey, my dear,” said the country-woman, “as sweet as the flowers; but fourpence a pound! Everything is as dear to-day as if it was set out for a nation of princes to be buyin’. But, holy Virgin, who at all is this?”
</p>
<p>
Sheila dared not raise her eyes; she held by the board with both hands and felt rather than saw that the purple-clad lady and her companions were descending upon her.
</p>
<p>
She heard a harsh laugh and saw the country-woman backing away, and looked up at last to see herself surrounded.
</p>
<p>
Right in front of her stared and laughed the face of the woman; it was of a strange whitish colour, with a wide smile — such a face as Sheila had never imagined, even in dreams. Instinctively she made the sign of the cross on her bosom, and “Christ be between us and harm! ” she murmured to herself.
</p>
<p>
“This is the young woman I told you about,” Hawks was saying loudly. “‘Pon me word, for as simple as she looks, it would be a good job if she was put out of the fair!”
</p>
<p>
Sheila looked up in horror. A crowd had gathered behind Hawks and round about her table; some of the young people were laughing and staring at the strange woman, but the older faces behind were serious enough.
</p>
<p>
“Ow, Mr. Hawks!” laughed the strange woman, “don’t ask me to believe in a face! The greatest little wretches ever I seen had the sweetest looks in the world. Lard, wat a parcel of wasps! They’re after the honey. I declare I dote upon honey meself.”
</p>
<p>
“Have some now,” said the lively officer.
</p>
<p>
“Give the good lady some honey, my dear,” said Hawks, smiling.
</p>
<p>
Sheila’s anger began to rise, and with it her courage; she looked straight into her enemy’s face, and said quietly:
</p>
<p>
“I could not give you any honey, even if you had manners in the asking. If I break the comb, I cannot sell it after.”
</p>
<p>
With a loud laugh the young officer snatched up a long-handled spoon and drove it into Sheila’s honey, breaking the comb and spoiling more than he took, while Hawks began working his way round to Sheila. “I’ll sell the honey for you fast enough,” he said. Sheila did not see that Mrs. Mulcahy and the farmer were making their way over to her, nor did she notice that many people in the crowd were scowling angrily at Hawks; she only saw the many eyes that looked and looked. She glanced despairingly round, and catching sight at the same moment of a familiar face, she ran from her place and pressed forward, calling, “Oh, Nora, Nora, let me go with you! Theresa has left me, and I’m all alone!” Her face was white and she was greatly affrighted.
</p>
<p>
But in place of the friendly welcome she had always had from Nora, she was treated to a new manner, a high and mighty stare.
</p>
<p>
“Well, and hasn’t she the face!” said Mrs. O’Hea, her round red countenance growing redder, and her voice audible to all around. “Nice tales they’re telling about you, young woman, and from all I see I think them true. Come along, Nora; what would Mylotte say?”
</p>
<p>
“Shame on ye, woman,” said a voice Sheila did not know, and a tall strapping woman put her arm about her and threw the corner of a wide shawl round her. “Come with me, my dear; I knew your mother well; it’s a shame for you to be left like this to run like a rabbit through the fair. Never take on, agra,” she said as Sheila turned and wept under the friendly shawl. “What’s this now? Saints alive! there’s Mick-a-Dandy. He’s goin’ to sell the honey for ye and, troth, he’s more than a match for them Hawkses. Husht now, and listen.”
</p>
<p>
Sheila looked out from her shelter, and there was Mick-a-Dandy standing on a tub behind her board, with his hands raised to heaven, and his face beaming with delight, as he confronted her enemies, who seemed to be trying to escape but could not for the crowd behind.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, then!” Mick-a-Dandy was saying, “who’d have thought it? The Lord be praised! If it isn’t Bould Bridget, the publican’s daughter out of Bawnboy that ran off with the tide-waiter! Ah, but you’re lookin’ grand! Ah, yerra, where at all did ye get the dhress, woman dear, and the little hat? Ah, Bridget darlin’, many’s the day I seen your mother, decent woman, waitin’ for ye in the back yard with her ould besom; for, says she, the bould strap’ll be afeared to come in the front way because of her dada, but she’ll think to play on her mammie, and little she knows the sort of sweepin’ I have ready for her. Arrah, Captain, your honour, what at all are ye goin’ on that way for? Sure, why wouldn’t I be glad to see Bridget Flannery? Haven’t I known her since the days she was runnin’ the linth of the gutter in Bawnboy, before your honour’s father so much as had the news of ye for good or evil? More betoken, yer honour had better be goin’ home: sign is on it, I met your honour’s father out raisin’ the country after ye, and a blackthorn stick in the trap behind him.” The crowd roared with laughter, and Mick- a-Dandy stood for a minute enjoying himself; he dipped his finger in the spilt honey and waved it in the air while three or four wasps flew and tried to settle upon it. Then he turned and shouted after Hawks, who was making his way through the crowd:
</p>
<p>
“Ah, your worship, glad and thankful I am to see ye laughin’ and jokin’ this mornin’, and the bailiffs gone out to Killaraa. ‘Deed the whole country’s sorry for yer honour, to think the noble house of Killaraa should come to disgrace for half a hundred dirty debts to poor tradespeople and farmers like. Troth and I think,” he went on, raising his voice higher and higher as his victims escaped, “yer honours might find a better mornin’s work to do than stravagin’ the country with Bridget Flannery. — Ah sure, they’re gone,” he said, looking about him with a smile, “and I might as well quit.”
</p>
<p>
The crowd laughed and cheered him. “Now,” said he, “who’ll buy the orphan’s honey? Mountain honey from Swanlabar: look at all them wasps come after it. Troth, and there’s been another kind of wasps about in the fair this mornin’, and it’s after something else than the honey they were. Let them that has a feelin’ heart buy the orphan’s honey, fourpence a pound!”
</p>
