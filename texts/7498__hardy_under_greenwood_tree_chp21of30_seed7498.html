<!-- CHAPTER IV: AN ARRANGEMENT -->
<p>“That <i>is</i> serious,” said Dick, more intellectually
than he had spoken for a long time.</p>
<p>The truth was that Geoffrey knew nothing about his daughter’s
continued walks and meetings with Dick. When a hint that there
were symptoms of an attachment between them had first reached Geoffrey’s
ears, he stated so emphatically that he must think the matter over before
any such thing could be allowed that, rather unwisely on Dick’s
part, whatever it might have been on the lady’s, the lovers were
careful to be seen together no more in public; and Geoffrey, forgetting
the report, did not think over the matter at all. So Mr. Shiner
resumed his old position in Geoffrey’s brain by mere flux of time.
Even Shiner began to believe that Dick existed for Fancy no more,—though
that remarkably easy-going man had taken no active steps on his own
account as yet.</p>
<p>“And father has not only told Mr. Shiner that,” continued
Fancy, “but he has written me a letter, to say he should wish
me to encourage Mr. Shiner, if ‘twas convenient!”</p>
<p>“I must start off and see your father at once!” said
Dick, taking two or three vehement steps to the south, recollecting
that Mr. Day lived to the north, and coming back again.</p>
<p>“I think we had better see him together. Not tell him
what you come for, or anything of the kind, until he likes you, and
so win his brain through his heart, which is always the way to manage
people. I mean in this way: I am going home on Saturday week to
help them in the honey-taking. You might come there to me, have
something to eat and drink, and let him guess what your coming signifies,
without saying it in so many words.”</p>
<p>“We’ll do it, dearest. But I shall ask him for
you, flat and plain; not wait for his guessing.” And the
lover then stepped close to her, and attempted to give her one little
kiss on the cheek, his lips alighting, however, on an outlying tract
of her back hair by reason of an impulse that had caused her to turn
her head with a jerk. “Yes, and I’ll put on my second-best
suit and a clean shirt and collar, and black my boots as if ‘twas
a Sunday. ‘Twill have a good appearance, you see, and that’s
a great deal to start with.”</p>
<p>“You won’t wear that old waistcoat, will you, Dick?”</p>
<p>“Bless you, no! Why I—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to be personal, dear Dick,” she
said, fearing she had hurt his feelings. “‘Tis a very
nice waistcoat, but what I meant was, that though it is an excellent
waistcoat for a settled-down man, it is not quite one for” (she
waited, and a blush expanded over her face, and then she went on again)—”for
going courting in.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll wear my best winter one, with the leather lining,
that mother made. It is a beautiful, handsome waistcoat inside,
yes, as ever anybody saw. In fact, only the other day, I unbuttoned
it to show a chap that very lining, and he said it was the strongest,
handsomest lining you could wish to see on the king’s waistcoat
himself.”</p>
<p>“<i>I</i> don’t quite know what to wear,” she said,
as if her habitual indifference alone to dress had kept back so important
a subject till now.</p>
<p>“Why, that blue frock you wore last week.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t set well round the neck. I couldn’t
wear that.”</p>
<p>“But I shan’t care.”</p>
<p>“No, you won’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Well, then it’s all right. Because you only care
how you look to me, do you, dear? I only dress for you, that’s
certain.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you see I couldn’t appear in it again very
well.”</p>
<p>“Any strange gentleman you mid meet in your journey might notice
the set of it, I suppose. Fancy, men in love don’t think
so much about how they look to other women.” It is difficult
to say whether a tone of playful banter or of gentle reproach prevailed
in the speech.</p>
<p>“Well then, Dick,” she said, with good-humoured frankness,
“I’ll own it. I shouldn’t like a stranger to
see me dressed badly, even though I am in love. ‘Tis our
nature, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“You perfect woman!”</p>
<p>“Yes; if you lay the stress on ‘woman,’”
she murmured, looking at a group of hollyhocks in flower, round which
a crowd of butterflies had gathered like female idlers round a bonnet-shop.</p>
<p>“But about the dress. Why not wear the one you wore at
our party?”</p>
<p>“That sets well, but a girl of the name of Bet Tallor, who
lives near our house, has had one made almost like it (only in pattern,
though of miserably cheap stuff), and I couldn’t wear it on that
account. Dear me, I am afraid I can’t go now.”</p>
<p>“O yes, you must; I know you will!” said Dick, with dismay.
“Why not wear what you’ve got on?”</p>
<p>“What! this old one! After all, I think that by wearing
my gray one Saturday, I can make the blue one do for Sunday. Yes,
I will. A hat or a bonnet, which shall it be? Which do I
look best in?”</p>
<p>“Well, I think the bonnet is nicest, more quiet and matronly.”</p>
<p>“What’s the objection to the hat? Does it make
me look old?”</p>
<p>“O no; the hat is well enough; but it makes you look rather
too—you won’t mind me saying it, dear?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, for I shall wear the bonnet.”</p>
<p>“—Rather too coquettish and flirty for an engaged young
woman.”</p>
<p>She reflected a minute. “Yes; yes. Still, after
all, the hat would do best; hats <i>are</i> best, you see. Yes,
I must wear the hat, dear Dicky, because I ought to wear a hat, you
know.”</p>
