<!-- Chapter 22 -->
<p>In a certain sense Meredith spoke the truth when he pronounced his resolution to farm the land to be the whim of an idle man, for the benevolent purpose doubtless had its source in emotions which forbade him, the strong, the rich, the independent, to look idly on while
the poor were starving, and the old and the feeble were spending their strength in vain. But, however much caprice might have influenced the man with whom impulse was always action, Meredith was not one to put his hand to the plough and then turn back, and he soon became a farmer in good earnest.</p>
<p>It was not enough to furnish money to the peasant, and stand as a nominal barrier betwixt him and his oppressors. The Lebanon mountaineers, though physically fearless and brave, and capable as all mountain races are of making forcible resistance to any attack upon their personal liberty, are nevertheless children in their simplicity and trustfulness of character. Exposed to political fraud and duplicity, they have long been accustomed to seek shelter under the wing of some feudal protector; and, though often deceived and betrayed, they are glad to purchase immunity from risk at the price of a faithful allegiance. El Fureidis, more fortunate than its neighbors,
had for years enjoyed prosperity and peace under the honest guardianship of M. Trefoil; in the incompetency of the master, the little village had felt itself orphaned; and finding in Meredith at once a benefactor and a mediator, it hailed him, in Eastern parlance, not only as “father of riches,” but as “parent of wisdom,” and “strong
arm of safety and power.”</p>
<p>Thus the Englishman found himself brought into individual relations with the peasantry, such as he never had foreseen, such indeed as his reserved nature would have repelled, had they been other than the gradual growth of circumstances.</p>
<p>Each householder felt himself responsible to the Howadji for the just use of his borrowed capital, each petty husbandman claimed a right to the Howadji’s advice in respect to tillage and crops. The ploughman of the Bekaa would postpone buying a yoke of oxen until the animals had been inspected by the English eye; even the village matrons anticipated with no little anxiety the Tall young Frank’s encomiums upon their vegetable-gardens and poultry-yards.</p>
<p>He became the arbiter of disputes, the judge from whose decision there was no appeal, and in the occasional visits which he made to the cities of the sea-board he found himself, to his surprise, the commissioned agent for the purchase of farming tools, provisions, and household utensils.</p>
<p>In all this he asked for no recompense,—he hoped for none. He nevertheless found his reward, not in Havilah’s approbation or encouragement,—for they labored in different spheres, met but seldom, and betrayed no consciousness of each other’s pursuits,—but occupation was medicine to his soul, and Father Lapierre’s prescription was already working the patient’s cure.</p>
<p>Not that Meredith carried a light heart into his labors, not that he became, in any degree, oblivious of the past He was everywhere and at all times thoughtful, grave, and sad. But life had become to him more earnest, his deeper sympathies were aroused, his human instincts quickened. Each day brought duties which could not be postponed or delegated to another; the welfare of a whole community was involved in them. The cry for help appealed first to his purse, then to his time, finally to his heart.</p>
<p>Havilah met him one morning outside the door of Tyiby’s cottage. The young girl carried in her hand a basin of broth for Tyiby’s sick son, who had rallied from the fever of the previous season only to waste with slow decline.</p>
<p>“You will be welcome,” said Meredith, as, having touched his hat and courteously wished her good morning, he stepped back a pace or two, and held open the heavy door through which he had just passed, and which he had left swinging on its pivot. “The boy is faint with long fasting, and the house affords no suitable food. I was about to send a message to you.”</p>
<p>“He has watched beside my boy’s bed ever since the shadows of nightfall,” said Tyiby, as she took the basin from Havilah’s hand, and looked after the retreating Englishman. “A mother’s blessing rest on his English hearth and home.”</p>
<p>“He is the last of his race, Tyiby,” said Havilah, solemnly. “His father and sister have died in his absence. The tidings have come to him over the sea. Father Lapierre told me yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Ah! the unfortunate one! May the Lord compassionate him!” exclaimed Tyiby, with feeling. “But truly, O child of Ianthe!” she continued, in a tone which had changed from that of sympathy to Christian triumph,”the Righteous One has not afflicted him in vain. Trouble has laid her hand on his brow,”—and the woman, with an expressive gesture, drew her finger in horizontal lines across
her own forehead,—”but sorrow is good seed sown here,”—and she touched her heart. “Sunshine is beautiful on young heads, Havilah, but it is the soft rain which ripens the harvests.”</p>
<p>Havilah was deeply struck with the truth, and its phraseology. Tyiby had unconsciously drawn the reverse side of that picture which Havilah had painted for her mother several months before.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when Havilah was returning from Baruk on one of her father’s donkeys, and accompanied only by Abou, she met in a narrow mountain-pass a young man leading a camel. The unwieldy “ship of the desert” was on an outward passage, laden merely with an axe, a clumsy saw, and a few iron wedges. It was destined to make the return voyage freighted with freshly-cut timber; for its master, son of Saad the miller, was a vigorous woodcutter, and the repairs going forward at El Fureidis had given an impetus to men of his craft.</p>
<p>Havilah stopped to exchange salutations, and inquire after his children, who, having lost their mother within a year past, were ordinarily intrusted to the old miller’s care during their father’s absence on the mountain.</p>
<p>“My fledglings are well,” answered the young man, dropping upon one knee, and kissing Havilah’s hand with a grace which belongs to the Oriental of every grade. “Blessings, lady, on those who saved their innocent lives!”</p>
<p>“The Englishman was prompt in rescuing the sufferers that night,” said Havilah. “You are going to cut wood on—”</p>
<p>She desired to give a new turn to the dialogue, but the young man interrupted her.</p>
<p>“The stately deer,” exclaimed he, “is sure to follow where the young doe leads the way; but a father’s blessing on you both. The master’s daughter has the first place in the people’s heart, but we know how to be grateful to the Englishman. I beheld him an hour ago, smoking a pipe,
in my father’s court-yard. Kassim was playing with the white hound of the Howadji; little Blossom was sitting on his knee. The old man’s face was a fountain of gladness, for the Frank has pledged his word, that, before the olives are ripe in the orchards, the mill shall stand in its place again, and be ready to press out the oil.”</p>
<p>“How generous he is!” said Havilah, with enthusiasm. “He is a prince in his bounty. I hope the people are loyal to him.”</p>
<p>“The Howadji was a prince, O daughter of Trefoil,” said the woodman, “when he sat erect on his horse, and scattered paras to the poor; but now he is something less than a prince, and something more, for the peasants have found in him a brother. We admire and fear the proud eagle which soars afar off and looks at the sun; but the swallow which hears our children’s call and nestles under our roof-tree, is the bird which we love.”</p>
<p>“How that proud English heart has melted! How the stranger has won the people’s love!” thought Havilah, as she journeyed homeward. She was musing thus, as she drew near the village.</p>
<p>“Behold the Howadji,” cried Abou, who was riding in the rear.</p>
<p>“Where?” exclaimed Havilah, starting from her reverie.</p>
<p>The old steward pointed to a figure at a little distance, approaching by the same path they were pursuing. A broad-brimmed hat concealed his face, his eyes were fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>“This way, Abou,” said Havilah, giving a nervous twitch to her rein, and diverging into a side path, overshadowed with shrubbery. “Go on, Abou; your donkey is fresher than mine.”</p>
<p>The old man went past his mistress at a trot. She loitered a moment under the shade of a clustering vine. The Englishman came up the steep pathway, absent-minded, thoughtful, and slow. With his cane he marked little circles on the ground, a melancholy habit always. He never
once raised his eyes. Ignorantly, he passed within a few feet of Havilah. It would have diverted, perhaps, the current of his meditations, had he known that she lingered there, watched his coming, traced the lines of sadness on his face, and sighed, went on a few paces, paused, looked
back, and sighed again.</p>
<p>Meredith had become a conscientious laborer, but his temperament was not one which could be satisfied with slow results; and, fortunately for his yet unschooled patience, evidences of success were not long wanting. In the genial climate and fruitful soil of Lebanon the disasters of a season, and the loss of a few weeks’ spring-time, are not so fatal to vegetation as in lands where the entire summer can scarcely ripen a single crop of grain. Industry rather than skill sufficed to repair all damages to the simple dwellings and rough terrace-walls of the peasants of El Fureidis; man, inspired by hope, wrought early and late, and nature did the rest.</p>
<p>Thus El Fureidis soon rose upon its ruins; shrubs, herbs, and vines grew, stretched, and clambered, as if striving to atone for past delay; flowers re-carpeted the earth, and gardens of promise smiled where desolation had darkly frowned. Thus the Scripture promise was literally fulfilled to the villagers. They had “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.”</p>
<p>One source of past prosperity, however, was wanting to El Fureidis, nor did there, seem to be any prospect of its revival. The factory, which had furnished the peasants with regular employment, and provided a sure market for their silk produce, remained precisely as it fell on the night of the catastrophe, as hopeless a ruin, apparently, as those of the Canaanitish temples on the mountain-top.</p>
<p>The loss of this life-spring of industry and revenue, with its bearing upon the fortunes of both people and master, was naturally a subject of speculation to all who cherished an interest in the common welfare, and it furnished a subject for much deliberation between M. Lapierre and Meredith, who might deservedly be styled, one the counsellor, the other the financier of the district.</p>

<p>These two men, at this time, shared a common dwelling. With the freakishness of a clouded mind, M. Trefoil, once domiciled in M. Lapierre’s cottage, proved loath to quit it for any other abode. Simple as were its arrangements, it afforded, on the whole, more comforts than remained in the dilapidated house of the manufacturer, and it was therefore decided that he should continue to occupy it for the present. Havilah, making light of her privations, cheerfully took possession of the little inner apartment, and Father Lapierre found in the least shattered rooms at the villa all the accommodation which his hardy habits demanded. For a while the convent continued to be Meredith’s nominal home; but gradually, as the demands upon his time made a nearer residence to the village desirable, he became domesticated in the very apartment which had formerly been allotted him in the dwelling of M. Trefoil. Its walls, indeed, were rent, its carpet and divans soiled and disfigured, its furniture broken or defaced; but Meredith was becoming an anchorite
in the matter of luxuries; the perfection of nature, and the unrivalled atmosphere without, atoned for every in-door discomfort, and the missionary and the Englishman experienced no conscious wants in their household.</p>
<p>They were sitting together one afternoon in the central saloon, which was the portion of the villa that had sustained least injury from the shock. It was evident that their conversation had been neither desultory nor languid; for though the day was warm, and the hour one usually devoted to repose, their attitude and expression betrayed the earnestness of men engaged in mutual counsel. It would seem that Meredith had been giving an account of his stewardship, for he held in his hand a long memorandum of rents and charges, which he finally folded and replaced in his
pocket, saying as he did so: “I have made it as simple as possible, and have so managed that I believe each landholder will be able to meet his payments as they fall due. If not, I leave it with you, my dear sir, to grant any reprieves you see fit. The business is simple; I have been
gradually initiating Asaad into all its details, and know no reason why he cannot henceforth represent me here.”</p>
<p>“And you will leave us then?” said Father Lapierre.</p>
<p>“Yes. There are those in England whom my father cared for and befriended, and who now have claims on me,—claims which I might selfishly have overlooked or slighted, but for ,the lesson taught me here. My presence is no longer needed in El Fureidis. In England, I believe I can be of use.”</p>
<p>“Go, then, my son,” said Father Lapierre, “and God go with you. Heaven’s breezes are sure to fill the sails of him who has duty for his rudder.”</p>
<p>“There is still one subject on which I would speak with you,” said Meredith, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“Speak on, my son.”</p>
<p>“M. Trefoil,—his resources, his future means of support. Have you penetrated the mystery which clouds his affairs?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Our friend’s usual apathy in respect to the business which recently engrossed him is only equalled by the inconsistency of the statements which he has from time to time made to me. On most subjects his mind has to a great degree recovered its tone, but I almost despair of
ever obtaining any clear insight into his pecuniary condition. I know of but one man who could throw any light upon this obscurity, and that is Mustapha Osman, the rich Turkish merchant at Damascus. He is the agent to whom M. Trefoil’s merchandise has been regularly consigned. Some surplus funds may yet remain in his hands. I strongly suspect, however, that the balance is in Mustapha’s favor. In the latter case, I fear M. Trefoil and his child are worse than beggared.”</p>

<p>“They must not want,” said Meredith, in a tone of resolve; “nor need they. M. Trefoil’s state of mind is childlike and unquestioning. Havilah is ignorant of her father’s insolvency. Both will accept your guardianship. You will labor among your flock; Havilah, as ever, will second all
your efforts. It is a mission which those who cannot actively aid should at least be proud to maintain. Let that be my care. Do not forbid me this small privilege, this sole consolation,” he continued, with passionate eagerness, as he already saw denial written on the features of M. Lapierre. “What you refuse to friendship you will at least let me lay on the altar of duty. You forget what I owe to your ministry and her example. Here I might not, perhaps, be your almoner; but if I go away,—if I put two thousand miles betwixt myself and El Fureidis,—if I am unknown in the matter to all but yourself,—there need be no scruples then. O my dear friend!” he added, enforcing his plea by a boyish urgency of tone and gesture, “I only ask to be a silent partner in your labors. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p>“Too well, my son,” said M. Lapierre, smiling kindly on the young man, but at the same time shaking his head in slow, emphatic negative to his appeal. “Havilah must not be deceived. If she serve Christ for hire, she must not do it in ignorance; she must not engage even in Christian warfare, without knowing at whose charges. The free child of the mountain must not be trammelled even by secret obligations. Do not chafe at the term,” he continued, silencing, by a wave of his hand, the expostulation which Meredith was about to utter. “I do not misunderstand you. I know you would be the last to esteem them obligations, but such they would nevertheless be. Havilah is a courageous girl, — she will not fear to meet the truth.”</p>
<p>“But the truth is cruel,—it will not spare,” cried Meredith, in tones of positive anguish. “I see written on its face famine, cold, and want,—a roofless home, an empty storehouse, a childish father, an unprotected child. M. Lapierre,” subjoined he, peremptorily, ” I was Havilah’s mother’s friend. I have a right to befriend Havilah.”</p>
<p>“Your right shall not be disputed,” he answered, soothingly. “But whatever you do must be done openly, and with Havilah’s consent.”</p>
<p>“That can never be,” exclaimed Meredith, with abruptness.</p>
<p>“To be frank with you, I doubt if it can, in the form to which you have alluded,” responded M. Lapierre. “But do not despair as to the future fortunes of M. Trefoil. You may yourself aid in opening his pathway to better days. It is possible you may be more successful than I have been in
discovering some clew to his embarrassments. Have you ever questioned him in reference to pecuniary matters?”</p>
<p>“I have not presumed to do so.”</p>
<p>“Under the circumstances, it would be no presumption. Follow up the hint I have given you regarding Mustapha Osman. Obtain what information you can. I will reflect upon the subject of our friend’s affairs, and speak with you again. Meanwhile, do not question, my son, that, whatever
be the lot of Havilah and her father, it will be well,—for is it not of the Lord’s appointing?”</p>
<p>The pastor’s hour of leisure was ended, and, taking up bis staff, he went out. Meredith looked at his watch. It was near the time when Havilah usually met the missionary at the village school, and, thinking it probable that he should find M. Trefoil alone, Meredith sallied forth for the visit, which it had become customary with him to take this opportunity of paying the afflicted man.</p>
<p>The door of the primitive parsonage stood open, and Meredith had gained the threshold, when he was arrested by the sound of Havilah’s voice from within. She seemed to be reading aloud, and Meredith hastily retreated. But he was too late. His shadow had fallen across the floor.
M. Trefoil recognized his figure as he withdrew, and called to him in a tone so much more cheerful than was his wont, that Meredith was arrested less by the words, “Hey! my friend, come in!” than by surprise at the heartiness of the salutation.</p>

<p>Thus summoned, he entered the dwelling, the inner obscurity of which contrasted so strongly with the midday glare outside, that his eye could only gradually distinguish the occupants of the apartment. M. Trefoil himself was the most prominent object. Wrapped in a flowered dressing-gown, his feet encased in yellow slippers, and his red tarboosh pushed back from his forehead, he sat upright upon the centre of the divan, and Meredith saw at a glance that his countenance wore an expression of animation which had been wanting for many weeks past. Havilah, with Ayib beside her, was seated on a cushion at her father’s feet. An open letter was on her lap. Meredith did not see her until the gazelle rubbed its head against his hand to attract attention. He then looked down at the little creature, perceived its mistress also, and bowed.</p>
<p>Havilah met his glance, bent her head in acknowledgment, and kept her eyes fixed upon the written page, from which she had been reading. At the same moment there was a slight movement in a remote part of the room; a dark figure in loose drapery rose from the corner, in which it had hitherto been concealed, and came forward a pace or two.</p>
<p>“Ah, Abdoul, my boy! is that you?” exclaimed Meredith, with a start of surprise as he recognized his Arab guide, of whom he had heard and seen nothing since the youth disappeared, unnoticed by any one, on the day of Ianthe’s burial.</p>
<p>Abdoul answered only by a silent obeisance; and, retreating into his corner, with one hand pressed upon his heart, slunk back against the wall, drew his turban over his brow, and folded his long, supple arms, or rather intertwined them, like a cable, across his breast.</p>
<p>“Sit down, Mr. Meredith, sit down,” cried M. Trefoil, with something of that clear ring to his voice which had formerly lent cordiality to his hospitable entreaties. Meredith took the seat to which his friend pointed. “We have news,” continued the latter, in a tone at once elated and
confidential,—”news from an unexpected quarter, and very welcome news too. Abdoul is a child of the desert, but he sees the world for all that. Abdoul is fresh from the Paris of the Orient. He brings us the latest news from Damascus; and, what is best of all, a letter from my friend, Mustapha Osman. Mustapha Osman has been my friend for years, Mr. Meredith, ever since I have been in El Fureidis; he is my consignee, my business agent, the framer of my fortunes, I may say. His own fortune is large,—large, sir, it is gigantic. So is his heart; he has the heart of an
emperor. He has written me a letter full of sympathy; not a word of business, but sympathy,—yes, real sympathy ;”—and with that quick transition of feeling which betrayed the still enfeebled mind, M. Trefoil, as he repeated the last word, became suddenly subdued, in his transitory
flow of spirits; and added, in a broken voice, wiping the tears from his eyes: “But you must hear what he says. Havilah, read the letter to Mr. Meredith. Begin at the beginning, my daughter, I shall like to hear it again ;”—and M. Trefoil threw his handkerchief over his face, and settled
himself on the divan, preparatory to listening, for the third time, to the grateful contents of the epistle.</p>
<p>The letter which Havilah read, in distinct, though now and then trembling utterance, ran thus:—</p>

<p>“Peace be with thee, O Augustine, brother of my heart, and widowed husband of Ianthe! peace be with thee, O man, greatly bereaved! and may He that pitieth and comforteth shower upon thee and upon thy household the choicest blessings with which He blesses. I extend my hand unto thee, O my brother, and embrace thee in my heart of hearts. I can take the measure of thy consuming sorrow,
for did not the angel of Death snatch from my bosom the faithful Fatimah, and bear her to the Paradise of the Prophet. Time, the consoler, has lifted up the head that was bowed down; but my spirit yet yearns for the beloved spouse of my youth, Fatimah, chief among women. Thus I hail
thee, O man of sorrow! and salute thee as a companion who has drunk with me from the bitter wells of affliction. Peace be with the dove-eyed daughter of thine house, who reposes no longer on the maternal breast; peace and benediction on the dark-haired Havilah, who came hither with thee a bud of promise, and whom Abdoul, son of Zanadeen, styles the Lebanon Rose. Say to the blooming maiden, that Maysunah, sole child of my affection, has ripened but to fade. She droops like a flower whose stem no longer drinks in the dew.</p>
<p>“Tell him of the snowy beard, dwelling beside thee on the sacred mount, that the aching soul of Mustapha remembers the gifts of his healing hand, and craves them for his child.</p>
<p>“Come hither, I pray thee, O Augustine, my brother. Damascus, a throned queen, sits among her gardens. Her fragrant breezes woo the sick at heart. The doors of Mustapha stand open wide, his spirit welcomes thee from afar. Come hither, and bring with thee a fair mate to Maysunah’s
loneliness, and him to whom Allah has given power to read disease and apply the remedy. Farewell; may thy soul take refuge with the Highest. The Ancient of benefits be thy protector, and so fulfil the prayer of Mustapha.</p>
<p>“Written in the name of Allah, and in the faith of Allah’s Prophet.”</p>
<p>There was a short silence as Havilah finished reading. It was broken by M. Trefoil, who, suddenly snatching away the handkerchief from his face, exclaimed, energetically, “Havilah, we must go to Damascus! Father Lapierre never refuses the call of the unfortunate. I must see my
friend, Mustapha. The journey will invigorate us all; we will go!”</p>
<p>With a startled expression, Havilah rose, and leaned on her father’s shoulder, out of reach of his eye. His sudden resolution and announcement alarmed her, and not without reason. It was difficult to judge whether they were the result of restored powers, or of an excitement more unnatural and painful than his previous dulness and apathy. She made no answer to his proposition.</p>
<p>“What say you, my child?” he asked, looking up into her face.</p>
<p>“As you think best,” she answered, dutifully, though with effort. Her heart trembled, not for herself, but for him. Already she foresaw and dreaded the perils of the way.</p>
<p>But M. Trefoil dreaded nothing. His elastic spirit was on the rebound. In a tone of exhilaration he now addressed himself to Meredith. “You will go with us, my friend,” he said, in a tone of confident assertion.</p>
<p>Meredith, unprepared for such a challenge, hesitated, and glanced at Havilah. Her eye was fixed upon him, as if in his answer was her only hope. “I will,” he responded, with decision.</p>
<p>“It is settled then, and we all go to Damascus in company,” proclaimed M. Trefoil, rubbing his hands together, in his characteristic way, as a token of satisfaction; and, a new and welcome turn thus given to his thoughts, he exhausted an hour of conversation in forming plans and mak-
ing suggestions concerning the journey so abruptly determined on. But he alone was at ease. Havilah looked distressed and anxious; Meredith, doubtful of the part he was expected to play.</p>
<p>As he rose to go, and M. Trefoil preceded him through the door-way, the young man, resolved to make sure of his position, stepped back, and said, in a low and apologetic tone, “Have I offended Havilah by my promise to her father?”</p>

<p>“Offended? O, no!” she answered, her eyes glistening through tears. “You are our best friend. You are like a father to the villagers; you are like a son to my father.”</p>
<p>As she inadvertently spoke the last words, and their import flashed upon her; the beautiful face, which a moment before had been unnaturally pale, became deeply tinged with crimson.</p>
<p>But Meredith, if he observed, mistook the cause of her confusion. In his manly simplicity he gave only the most natural interpretation to her words, and replied, as if reassured on a mere point of doubt: “Thank you; you are too kind. I do not deserve your praise; but, with your permission, I shall be proud and happy to travel with you to Damascus ;”—and, his resolution thus confirmed, he bade her farewell.</p>
<p>In the corner, meanwhile, sat one who needed no such confirmation of the truth. He could not hear the last, low-spoken words of the Englishman and Havilah, nor did his quick instincts demand any such literal medium of intercourse. With that keenness unknown to the civilized man, 
the young savage had marked that mutual play of feature which was to him an open book. His flashing eyes, like electric balls, had intercepted the subtile fluid which was transmitted along the line of thought, and with unerring accuracy he read the import of the telegraphic message.</p>
