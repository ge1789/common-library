    How trace the why and wherefore in a mind reduced to the barrenness of
    a fastidious egoism, in which all direct desires are dulled, and have
    dwindled from motives into a vacillating expectation of motives: a
    mind made up of moods, where a fitful impulse springs here and there
    conspicuously rank amid the general weediness? ‘Tis a condition apt to
    befall a life too much at large, unmoulded by the pressure of
    obligation. <em>Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentiae</em>, or, as a more
    familiar tongue might deliver it, <em>“As you like” is a bad finger-post.</em>
    </p>

<p>
  Potentates make known their intentions and affect the funds at a small
  expense of words. So when Grandcourt, after learning that Gwendolen had
  left Leubronn, incidentally pronounced that resort of fashion a beastly
  hole, worse than Baden, the remark was conclusive to Mr. Lush that his
  patron intended straightway to return to Diplow. The execution was sure to
  be slower than the intention, and, in fact, Grandcourt did loiter through
  the next day without giving any distinct orders about departure—perhaps
  because he discerned that Lush was expecting them: he lingered over his
  toilet, and certainly came down with a faded aspect of perfect distinction
  which made fresh complexions and hands with the blood in them, seem signs
  of raw vulgarity; he lingered on the terrace, in the gambling-rooms, in
  the reading-room, occupying himself in being indifferent to everybody and
  everything around him. When he met Lady Mallinger, however, he took some
  trouble—raised his hat, paused, and proved that he listened to her
  recommendation of the waters by replying, “Yes; I heard somebody say
  how providential it was that there always happened to be springs at
  gambling places.”
</p>
<p>
  “Oh, that was a joke,” said innocent Lady Mallinger, misled by
  Grandcourt’s languid seriousness, “in imitation of the old one
  about the towns and the rivers, you know.”
</p>
<p>
  “Ah, perhaps,” said Grandcourt, without change of expression.
  Lady Mallinger thought this worth telling to Sir Hugo, who said, “Oh,
  my dear, he is not a fool. You must not suppose that he can’t see a
  joke. He can play his cards as well as most of us.”
</p>
<p>
  “He has never seemed to me a very sensible man,” said Lady
  Mallinger, in excuse of herself. She had a secret objection to meeting
  Grandcourt, who was little else to her than a large living sign of what
  she felt to be her failure as a wife—the not having presented Sir
  Hugo with a son. Her constant reflection was that her husband might fairly
  regret his choice, and if he had not been very good might have treated her
  with some roughness in consequence, gentlemen naturally disliking to be
  disappointed.
</p>
<p>
  Deronda, too, had a recognition from Grandcourt, for which he was not
  grateful, though he took care to return it with perfect civility. No
  reasoning as to the foundations of custom could do away with the
  early-rooted feeling that his birth had been attended with injury for
  which his father was to blame; and seeing that but for this injury
  Grandcourt’s prospects might have been his, he was proudly resolute
  not to behave in any way that might be interpreted into irritation on that
  score. He saw a very easy descent into mean unreasoning rancor and triumph
  in others’ frustration; and being determined not to go down that
  ugly pit, he turned his back on it, clinging to the kindlier affections
  within him as a possession. Pride certainly helped him well—the
  pride of not recognizing a disadvantage for one’s self which vulgar
  minds are disposed to exaggerate, such as the shabby equipage of poverty:
  he would not have a man like Grandcourt suppose himself envied by him. But
  there is no guarding against interpretation. Grandcourt did believe that
  Deronda, poor devil, who he had no doubt was his cousin by the father’s
  side, inwardly winced under their mutual position; wherefore the presence
  of that less lucky person was more agreeable to him than it would
  otherwise have been. An imaginary envy, the idea that others feel their
  comparative deficiency, is the ordinary <em>cortège</em> of egoism; and his
  pet dogs were not the only beings that Grandcourt liked to feel his power
  over in making them jealous. Hence he was civil enough to exchange several
  words with Deronda on the terrace about the hunting round Diplow, and even
  said, “You had better come over for a run or two when the season
  begins.”
</p>
<p>
  Lush, not displeased with delay, amused himself very well, partly in
  gossiping with Sir Hugo and in answering his questions about Grandcourt’s
  affairs so far as they might affect his willingness to part with his
  interest in Diplow. Also about Grandcourt’s personal entanglements,
  the baronet knew enough already for Lush to feel released from silence on
  a sunny autumn day, when there was nothing more agreeable to do in
  lounging promenades than to speak freely of a tyrannous patron behind his
  back. Sir Hugo willingly inclined his ear to a little good-humored
  scandal, which he was fond of calling <em>traits de moeurs</em>; but he was
  strict in keeping such communications from hearers who might take them too
  seriously. Whatever knowledge he had of his nephew’s secrets, he had
  never spoken of it to Deronda, who considered Grandcourt a pale-blooded
  mortal, but was far from wishing to hear how the red corpuscles had been
  washed out of him. It was Lush’s policy and inclination to gratify
  everybody when he had no reason to the contrary; and the baronet always
  treated him well, as one of those easy-handled personages who, frequenting
  the society of gentlemen, without being exactly gentlemen themselves, can
  be the more serviceable, like the second-best articles of our wardrobe,
  which we use with a comfortable freedom from anxiety.
</p>
<p>
  “Well, you will let me know the turn of events,” said Sir
  Hugo, “if this marriage seems likely to come off after all, or if
  anything else happens to make the want of money pressing. My plan would be
  much better for him than burdening Ryelands.”
</p>
<p>
  “That’s true,” said Lush, “only it must not be
  urged on him—just placed in his way that the scent may tickle him.
  Grandcourt is not a man to be always led by what makes for his own
  interest; especially if you let him see that it makes for your interest
  too. I’m attached to him, of course. I’ve given up everything
  else for the sake of keeping by him, and it has lasted a good fifteen
  years now. He would not easily get any one else to fill my place. He’s
  a peculiar character, is Henleigh Grandcourt, and it has been growing on
  him of late years. However, I’m of a constant disposition, and I’ve
  been a sort of guardian to him since he was twenty; an uncommonly
  fascinating fellow he was then, to be sure—and could be now, if he
  liked. I’m attached to him; and it would be a good deal worse for
  him if he missed me at his elbow.”
</p>
<p>
  Sir Hugo did not think it needful to express his sympathy or even assent,
  and perhaps Lush himself did not expect this sketch of his motives to be
  taken as exact. But how can a man avoid himself as a subject in
  conversation? And he must make some sort of decent toilet in words, as in
  cloth and linen. Lush’s listener was not severe: a member of
  Parliament could allow for the necessities of verbal toilet; and the
  dialogue went on without any change of mutual estimate.
</p>
<p>
  However, Lush’s easy prospect of indefinite procrastination was cut
  off the next morning by Grandcourt’s saluting him with the question,
</p>
<p>
  “Are you making all the arrangements for our starting by the Paris
  train?”
</p>
<p>
  “I didn’t know you meant to start,” said Lush, not
  exactly taken by surprise.
</p>
<p>
  “You might have known,” said Grandcourt, looking at the burned
  length of his cigar, and speaking in that lowered tone which was usual
  with him when he meant to express disgust and be peremptory. “Just
  see to everything, will you? and mind no brute gets into the same carriage
  with us. And leave my P. P. C. at the Mallingers’.”
</p>
<p>
  In consequence they were at Paris the next day; but here Lush was
  gratified by the proposal or command that he should go straight on to
  Diplow and see that everything was right, while Grandcourt and the valet
  remained behind; and it was not until several days later that Lush
  received the telegram ordering the carriage to the Wanchester station.
</p>
<p>
  He had used the interim actively, not only in carrying out Grandcourt’s
  orders about the stud and household, but in learning all he could of
  Gwendolen, and how things were going on at Offendene. What was the
  probable effect that the news of the family misfortunes would have on
  Grandcourt’s fitful obstinacy he felt to be quite incalculable. So
  far as the girl’s poverty might be an argument that she would accept
  an offer from him now in spite of any previous coyness, it might remove
  that bitter objection to risk a repulse which Lush divined to be one of
  Grandcourt’s deterring motives; on the other hand, the certainty of
  acceptance was just “the sort of thing” to make him lapse
  hither and thither with no more apparent will than a moth. Lush had had
  his patron under close observation for many years, and knew him perhaps
  better than he knew any other subject; but to know Grandcourt was to doubt
  what he would do in any particular case. It might happen that he would
  behave with an apparent magnanimity, like the hero of a modern French
  drama, whose sudden start into moral splendor after much lying and
  meanness, leaves you little confidence as to any part of his career that
  may follow the fall of the curtain. Indeed, what attitude would have been
  more honorable for a final scene than that of declining to seek an heiress
  for her money, and determining to marry the attractive girl who had none?
  But Lush had some general certainties about Grandcourt, and one was that
  of all inward movements those of generosity were least likely to occur in
  him. Of what use, however, is a general certainty that an insect will not
  walk with his head hindmost, when what you need to know is the play of
  inward stimulus that sends him hither and thither in a network of possible
  paths? Thus Lush was much at fault as to the probable issue between
  Grandcourt and Gwendolen, when what he desired was a perfect confidence
  that they would never be married. He would have consented willingly that
  Grandcourt should marry an heiress, or that he should marry Mrs. Glasher:
  in the one match there would have been the immediate abundance that
  prospective heirship could not supply, in the other there would have been
  the security of the wife’s gratitude, for Lush had always been Mrs.
  Glasher’s friend; and that the future Mrs. Grandcourt should not be
  socially received could not affect his private comfort. He would not have
  minded, either, that there should be no marriage in question at all; but
  he felt himself justified in doing his utmost to hinder a marriage with a
  girl who was likely to bring nothing but trouble to her husband—not
  to speak of annoyance if not ultimate injury to her husband’s old
  companion, whose future Mr. Lush earnestly wished to make as easy as
  possible, considering that he had well deserved such compensation for
  leading a dog’s life, though that of a dog who enjoyed many tastes
  undisturbed, and who profited by a large establishment. He wished for
  himself what he felt to be good, and was not conscious of wishing harm to
  any one else; unless perhaps it were just now a little harm to the
  inconvenient and impertinent Gwendolen. But the easiest-humored of luxury
  and music, the toad-eater the least liable to nausea, must be expected to
  have his susceptibilities. And Mr. Lush was accustomed to be treated by
  the world in general as an apt, agreeable fellow: he had not made up his
  mind to be insulted by more than one person.
</p>
<p>
  With this imperfect preparation of a war policy, Lush was awaiting
  Grandcourt’s arrival, doing little more than wondering how the
  campaign would begin. The first day Grandcourt was much occupied with the
  stables, and amongst other things he ordered a groom to put a side-saddle
  on Criterion and let him review the horse’s paces. This marked
  indication of purpose set Lush on considering over again whether he should
  incur the ticklish consequences of speaking first, while he was still sure
  that no compromising step had been taken; and he rose the next morning
  almost resolved that if Grandcourt seemed in as good a humor as yesterday
  and entered at all into talk, he would let drop the interesting facts
  about Gwendolen and her family, just to see how they would work, and to
  get some guidance. But Grandcourt did not enter into talk, and in answer
  to a question even about his own convenience, no fish could have
  maintained a more unwinking silence. After he had read his letters he gave
  various orders to be executed or transmitted by Lush, and then thrust his
  shoulder toward that useful person, who accordingly rose to leave the
  room. But before he was out of the door Grandcourt turned his head
  slightly and gave a broken, languid “Oh.”
</p>
<p>
  “What is it?” said Lush, who, it must have been observed, did
  not take his dusty puddings with a respectful air.
</p>
<p>
  “Shut the door, will you? I can’t speak into the corridor.”
</p>
<p>
  Lush closed the door, came forward, and chose to sit down.
</p>
<p>
  After a little pause Grandcourt said, “Is Miss Harleth at Offendene?”
  He was quite certain that Lush had made it his business to inquire about
  her, and he had some pleasure in thinking that Lush did not want <em>him</em>
  to inquire.
</p>
<p>
  “Well, I hardly know,” said Lush, carelessly. “The
  family’s utterly done up. They and the Gascoignes too have lost all
  their money. It’s owing to some rascally banking business. The poor
  mother hasn’t a <em>sou</em>, it seems. She and the girls have to
  huddle themselves into a little cottage like a laborer’s.”
</p>
<p>
  “Don’t lie to me, if you please,” said Grandcourt, in
  his lowest audible tone. “It’s not amusing, and it answers no
  other purpose.”
</p>
<p>
  “What do you mean?” said Lush, more nettled than was common
  with him—the prospect before him being more than commonly
  disturbing.
</p>
<p>
  “Just tell me the truth, will you?”
</p>
<p>
  “It’s no invention of mine. I have heard the story from
  several—Bazley, Brackenshaw’s man, for one. He is getting a
  new tenant for Offendene.”
</p>
<p>
  “I don’t mean that. Is Miss Harleth there, or is she not?”
  said Grandcourt, in his former tone.
</p>
<p>
  “Upon my soul, I can’t tell,” said Lush, rather sulkily.
  “She may have left yesterday. I heard she had taken a situation as
  governess; she may be gone to it for what I know. But if you wanted to see
  her no doubt the mother would send for her back.” This sneer slipped
  off his tongue without strict intention.
</p>
<p>
  “Send Hutchins to inquire whether she will be there tomorrow.”
  Lush did not move. Like many persons who have thought over beforehand what
  they shall say in given cases, he was impelled by an unexpected irritation
  to say some of those prearranged things before the cases were given.
  Grandcourt, in fact, was likely to get into a scrape so tremendous that it
  was impossible to let him take the first step toward it without
  remonstrance. Lush retained enough caution to use a tone of rational
  friendliness, still he felt his own value to his patron, and was prepared
  to be daring.
</p>
<p>
  “It would be as well for you to remember, Grandcourt, that you are
  coming under closer fire now. There can be none of the ordinary flirting
  done, which may mean everything or nothing. You must make up your mind
  whether you wish to be accepted; and more than that, how you would like
  being refused. Either one or the other. You can’t be philandering
  after her again for six weeks.”
</p>
<p>
  Grandcourt said nothing, but pressed the newspaper down on his knees and
  began to light another cigar. Lush took this as a sign that he was willing
  to listen, and was the more bent on using the opportunity; he wanted, if
  possible, to find out which would be the more potent cause of hesitation—probable
  acceptance or probable refusal.
</p>
<p>
  “Everything has a more serious look now than it had before. There is
  her family to be provided for. You could not let your wife’s mother
  live in beggary. It will be a confoundedly hampering affair. Marriage will
  pin you down in a way you haven’t been used to; and in point of
  money you have not too much elbow-room. And after all, what will you get
  by it? You are master over your estates, present or future, as far as
  choosing your heir goes; it’s a pity to go on encumbering them for a
  mere whim, which you may repent of in a twelvemonth. I should be sorry to
  see you making a mess of your life in that way. If there were anything
  solid to be gained by the marriage, that would be a different affair.”
</p>
<p>
  Lush’s tone had gradually become more and more unctuous in its
  friendliness of remonstrance, and he was almost in danger of forgetting
  that he was merely gambling in argument. When he left off, Grandcourt took
  his cigar out of his mouth, and looking steadily at the moist end while he
  adjusted the leaf with his delicate finger-tips, said,
</p>
<p>
  “I knew before that you had an objection to my marrying Miss
  Harleth.” Here he made a little pause before he continued. “But
  I never considered that a reason against it.”
</p>
<p>
  “I never supposed you did,” answered Lush, not unctuously but
  dryly. “It was not <em>that</em> I urged as a reason. I should have
  thought it might have been a reason against it, after all your experience,
  that you would be acting like the hero of a ballad, and making yourself
  absurd—and all for what? You know you couldn’t make up your
  mind before. It’s impossible you can care much about her. And as for
  the tricks she is likely to play, you may judge of that from what you
  heard at Leubronn. However, what I wished to point out to you was, that
  there can be no shilly-shally now.”
</p>
<p>
  “Perfectly,” said Grandcourt, looking round at Lush and fixing
  him with narrow eyes; “I don’t intend that there should be. I
  dare say it’s disagreeable to you. But if you suppose I care a damn
  for that you are most stupendously mistaken.”
</p>
<p>
  “Oh, well,” said Lush, rising with his hands in his pockets,
  and feeling some latent venom still within him, “if you have made up
  your mind!—only there’s another aspect of the affair. I have
  been speaking on the supposition that it was absolutely certain she would
  accept you, and that destitution would have no choice. But I am not so
  sure that the young lady is to be counted on. She is kittle cattle to
  shoe, I think. And she had her reasons for running away before.”
  Lush had moved a step or two till he stood nearly in front of Grandcourt,
  though at some distance from him. He did not feel himself much restrained
  by consequences, being aware that the only strong hold he had on his
  present position was his serviceableness; and even after a quarrel the
  want of him was likely sooner or later to recur. He foresaw that Gwendolen
  would cause him to be ousted for a time, and his temper at this moment
  urged him to risk a quarrel.
</p>
<p>
  “She had her reasons,” he repeated more significantly.
</p>
<p>
  “I had come to that conclusion before,” said Grandcourt, with
  contemptuous irony.
</p>
<p>
  “Yes, but I hardly think you know what her reasons were.”
</p>
<p>
  “You do, apparently,” said Grandcourt, not betraying by so
  much as an eyelash that he cared for the reasons.
</p>
<p>
  “Yes, and you had better know too, that you may judge of the
  influence you have over her if she swallows her reasons and accepts you.
  For my own part I would take odds against it. She saw Lydia in Cardell
  Chase and heard the whole story.”
</p>
<p>
  Grandcourt made no immediate answer, and only went on smoking. He was so
  long before he spoke that Lush moved about and looked out of the windows,
  unwilling to go away without seeing some effect of his daring move. He had
  expected that Grandcourt would tax him with having contrived the affair,
  since Mrs. Glasher was then living at Gadsmere, a hundred miles off, and
  he was prepared to admit the fact: what he cared about was that Grandcourt
  should be staggered by the sense that his intended advances must be made
  to a girl who had that knowledge in her mind and had been scared by it. At
  length Grandcourt, seeing Lush turn toward him, looked at him again and
  said, contemptuously, “What follows?”
</p>
<p>
  Here certainly was a “mate” in answer to Lush’s “check”;
  and though his exasperation with Grandcourt was perhaps stronger than it
  had ever been before, it would have been idiocy to act as if any further
  move could be useful. He gave a slight shrug with one shoulder, and was
  going to walk away, when Grandcourt, turning on his seat toward the table,
  said, as quietly as if nothing had occurred, “Oblige me by pushing
  that pen and paper here, will you?”
</p>
<p>
  No thunderous, bullying superior could have exercised the imperious spell
  that Grandcourt did. Why, instead of being obeyed, he had never been told
  to go to a warmer place, was perhaps a mystery to those who found
  themselves obeying him. The pen and paper were pushed to him, and as he
  took them he said, “Just wait for this letter.”
</p>
<p>
  He scrawled with ease, and the brief note was quickly addressed. “Let
  Hutchins go with it at once, will you?” said Grandcourt, pushing the
  letter away from him.
</p>
<p>
  As Lush had expected, it was addressed to Miss Harleth, Offendene. When
  his irritation had cooled down he was glad there had been no explosive
  quarrel; but he felt sure that there was a notch made against him, and
  that somehow or other he was intended to pay. It was also clear to him
  that the immediate effect of his revelation had been to harden Grandcourt’s
  previous determination. But as to the particular movements that made this
  process in his baffling mind, Lush could only toss up his chin in despair
  of a theory.
</p>
