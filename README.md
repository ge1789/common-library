Random Canon and Reprint Canon
=================================

This repository contains chapters (randomly sampled) from novels. The novels themselves are randomly sampled from two populations:

-	Novels published in the British Isles for the first time between 1837 and 1901 (**Random Canon**).
-	Novels in the above population which were still available (i.e., in print) in 2017 from Penguin, Oxford, or Broadview (**Reprint Canon**).

Manifest
--------
